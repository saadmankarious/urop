bailster09_152xp5e,"I have an LG Ultra gear and the hdmi falls out, I have tried many different cables. I can’t even get a display because the cable cannot fully connect. The plate on the back of the monitor sticks out a bit. This causes the plate on the hdmi cable to be too short due to the jackets on the cable and therefore the plate is a bit too short to connect. There are not any adjustments that can be made on the plate on the monitor, it’s almost like it needs to be pushed in.

bailster09_werqce,"My mom decided to randomly scream at me. I felt so terrified.  I was in my closet shaking and crying. 
She said I was the emotionally abusive one and not her. I screamed at her to stop, yet she kept screaming at me. She said ""you can go tell your shrink about me, I doubt you tell her everything you do, and she can tell you to do all these things but none of it will fucking work on me.""
Then she said I will end up alone becuase no one would ever put up with me. (Which I try to fight it because rationally I am smart, funny, and I know my boyfriend is with me for me.)
This I feel like was projection onto me. Since my dad died she has become an alcoholic and has dated A LOT since then, and we all know she is going to end up alone. 

I am 27 and for some reason I put up with it for too long. I have been in and out since high school. I have a really good job in IT and good friends. My therapist and I were working on a plan for me to leave the house in the next month or two. Before I knew it last night I get thrown out of the house. My boyfriend recently moved 4 hours away for med school, so I was planning on moving up there 10 months from now.

My boyfriend and I have been together for 6, going on 7 months. We have been long distance for two months. (4 hours away so we still see each other a few times a month and I can work up there.)

I feel like this has been hard on me lately and I am scared to say it or bring it up. I feel like I may be pulling a way a bit as a fear he doesn’t feel the same way.

The-Unmentionable_1ddkras,"I don’t trust what companies claim on their websites. I don’t trust the sites that compile groups of sustainable companies (they can be paid off by the companies). It’s near impossible to trust anyone but I do the best I can. Even if what they claim is true, there’s a lot of picking and choosing on what info is shared to make themselves seem better than they are. 

Basically, I’d love to find the genuinely sustainable companies that sell their raw materials to companies that make products with said materials and work backwards. I’d basically try my best to only use companies that the raw material makers confirm use their materials if that makes sense. It’s still not a perfect system but I think it’s the most likely to yield how at results.

The-Unmentionable_1dbxu1k,"I’m sorry to the roach lovers on this sub but both were near dead when I found them, I’m assuming from the buckets of poison I sprayed when I first moved in 2 months ago.

The-Unmentionable_1d91nmj,"It took me til my early 30s to realize I’ve been setting myself up for failure by trying to meal prep instead of ingredient prep. 

I’d get so bored of eating the same foods, even when I freeze them to have weeks later. I’d also procrastinate making the meal because, no matter how simple the meal is, the idea of cooking it sounded daunting. I’m not saying my logic makes sense, but it was my barrier to entry. I just wouldn’t do it && when I did, anything beyond the 3rd meal eventually went to waste.

Then one day I prepped one part of meal and I’ve never gone back. I buy a few avocados and make a spread. The spread is divided up into about 1/4 an avocado portions and put in my freezer. It’s delicious, still looks fresh and green when I use it, and very easily elevates a variety of otherwise sad basic meals. I do the same with breaded chicken breasts. I make many at once, freeze them, and use them for all kinds of meals (sandwiches, pasta, salad, stir fry, etc). 

It allows for maximum options with minimal cook time. I can’t believe I ever bothered doing anything else so I’m curious which others prefer if they have a preference at all. 
"
The-Unmentionable_1d0jjz3,"I have a few different friend groups and have had others come and go over the years and go through periods of feeling really isolated in large part because of my relationship with pot (and other drugs and alcohol). 

For the most part I am sober all day and smoke a little to unwind at night. I occasionally day smoke and do chores or day smoke after committing to a “do nothing but chill & reset” day but not often. I find longer breaks of sobriety more appealing as I get older and have gone completely sober for 4-8 week periods over the last few years. 

I don’t ever feel like my friends are pressuring me to smoke or anything and I have turned down offers many a time but I admit rejecting free anything is hard for me. The issue is more that my pothead friends make pot a constant in *everything* we do. Every beach day, concert, “productivity” hangout, movie night, coffee meetup, dinner party, EVERYTHING. It all starts with a smoke session with smoke session intermissions and goodbyes. Sometimes I just want to have a nice afternoon in a pumpkin patch without hot boxing the car first! 

On the flip side, other groups of mine were never big into smoking and may “be bad” and have a hit or two before a concert but it’s not a part of their life. While they don’t openly judge me, I hear the way they talk about pot smokers when we are out and it’s often just a touch too prudish for my liking. They have complaints about the smell and about when and where people should be doing it and just generally have a lot of opinions on a subject they aren’t really a part of. It makes me feel like I cannot truly be myself or share certain parts of my life because they don’t understand the positive parts of regular smoking. 

No matter who I’m around, I just can’t seem to relate and I’m having a fleeting moment of being annoyed by this so I’m venting some to a community more likely to understand where I’m coming from.

The-Unmentionable_1cztp82,"Apologies if this gets asked a lot, it’s my first time here. I have an above average understanding of how credit works, generally speaking but there is one thing that’s never made sense to me. I’m hoping someone here can shed some light on what I’m missing.

Unless I’m misunderstanding, it seems like my credit score is very easy to drop but very difficult to raise, even when I have fully “undone” the thing that caused the drop. What I mean by this is: 

I make a large purchase on my 0% Intro APR credit card, causing my card utilization to go from 0% to 15%. As a result my score goes down 40 points. Within the next 30 days I paid the credit card off 100% and my card utilization returns to 0%. The following month, my credit goes up 12 points. The month after that it goes up 2 points. The month after that, no changes. 

What gives? How can the same amount of money be -40 points to charge but only +14 to pay off? There is nothing else changing that could contribute to this disparity so I don’t understand how this happens. FYI these are example numbers to represent what I’m seeing, not my exact to the decimal situation. 

Please help me make sense of it. Thanks! "
The-Unmentionable_1ctkxpm,"I’m familiar with command strips and have had no issues with them thus far. Typically I use more than the 4 they suggest to be on the safe side with the heaviest weight being about 12lbs or so. 

I’m in a new apartment with plaster walls and want to hang an item that’s 16lbs. I have a ton of 16lb and 20lb strips to use and figured I’d use 12-16 strips which should in theory be more than enough to hold it up but I’m still nervous. I can’t even find a YouTube video of anyone pressure testing this which makes me hesitant. 

I’m hoping some people here can put my worries at ease. If the item falls and breaks I won’t be heartbroken but want to avoid damaging my walls from the weight not being distributed well enough. And don’t worry, I know how to remove these after years of secure stickiness without damaging the walls so intentional removal is not my concern, only unintentional falls! "
The-Unmentionable_1cqa87t,"I’ve been a Spotify user since they launched but only recently started listening to podcasts. There’s a couple issues I’ve ran into that left me wondering what, if any solutions exist. 

1: If I pause a podcast and then add a song to the queue, is there a way to get to that queue? If a song is paused I can easily hit the “>” button to play my queued song. There is no “>” button with podcasts. As a work around I’ve been clicking a random song before immediately skipping it but I feel there must be a better way. 

2: How do I completely remove a podcast so it stops auto playing after other podcasts I listen to? I once listened to a single episode of a podcast I didn’t much like. Since then, if I’ve already played the next episode in any podcast it will jump to playing the one I don’t like instead of jumping to any other unplayed episode of the podcast I originally put on. I’m just sick of this unwanted podcast in the mix and want it gone. Erasing the podcast profile from my history hasn’t helped any.

The-Unmentionable_1bk8nt4,"My landlord just sold the house and my new landlord is beyond clueless. A couple days ago they texted me an email address saying all communications, including for emergencies, will have to be communicated via email as they “won’t be able to be reached by this number anymore”. 

This is because they wanted to block my phone number. They have not taken kindly to me reminding them of the law when they’ve tried breaking it. One example being that they texted me a “clear out” date after being pre approved for the mortgage, months before they legally owned the building. 

Obviously I’ll be out of this situation in a couple weeks but in the mean time I’ve never had a landlord not provide a phone number for potential emergencies and am wondering if this is yet another illegal thing they are trying to pull. So do they legally have to provide a phone number or is email sufficient under Philly/PA law?

The-Unmentionable_1bi93ni,"I’m sure it sounds like a silly question but I’m a renter and really don’t know about this stuff. 

Very long story short my downstairs neighbor has been in the process of buying the house we live in the past couple months. They have already tried a handful of times to talk to me as if they are already my landlord (like texting me a move out date after being preapproved for the mortgage).  

As far as I know they have the keys now and officially own this place but I’m not positive. They texted today that insurance inspectors want to come tomorrow while I’m at work and will need to see my apartment. I said okay but plan on locking my door before leaving for work. That shouldn’t be an issue unless she doesn’t have the keys yet as far as I know. I clearly can’t trust this person to follow the law with this stuff and want to make sure she isn’t again overstepping her legal authority over me.

The-Unmentionable_1be32y9,"Aside from my childhood twin bed I’ve only ever slept on a queen. I’m about to move from a two bedroom apartment to a tiny studio and thought it might be worth downsizing to a full for more living space. Moving my old queen to test the size or moving with no mattress until I decide aren’t viable options for me. 

My big concern is my feet feeling trapped under covers at the base of the bed because the full is too short in comparison to my queen. I *need* my feet to not hang off unless I choose to do so and I *need* to not feel where the sheet folds under the mattress. I know it sounds picky and silly to some but it’s who I am (for reasons). I will never be happy or sleep well if either of those things happen.

So I went to IKEA today to test some full sized mattresses and realized that some had plenty of space by my feet & head while others were an instantaneous heck no never. They were all “full sizes”. This sub Reddit and the internet explained to me that mattresses can be upwards of 4 inches shorter than advertised and still considered normal. 

Well those 4 inches are absolutely critical for me. It’s the difference between a yes okay and an absolutely positively never! Is there *any* way you be certain the mattress I take home is closer to the listed measurements than -4 inches from what’s listed? If not I may have to stick with a queen to avoid the headache and cost to exchange. I’m too broke for this move as it is and am sour on having to do any of this in the first place so I’m trying to minimize cost and challenges. 

If anyone has some experience with downsizing from a queen to a full or has info on the variability of sizes I’d love to hear it! "

I haven’t asked but I got the vibe that the landlord will not want me drilling holes into plaster (he made a point to tell me it had plaster walls because an old tenant of his seemed to have had issues with that). 

I don’t mind using a bunch of command strips for pictures and mirrors but I’m nervous about putting shelves up with them, especially because I have a cat who will inevitably jump up on them at some point.

I don’t want anything breaking falling off the wall as I won’t be able to pay to have anything replaced and I’m already sad enough about needing to move and having to pay more in rent for a much smaller space.

If anyone has experience hanging a lot of stuff on plaster walls (not drywall) in a rental (not owned by you) please share your stories so I can waste no time making the space cozy once I’m there.

The-Unmentionable_1afvume,"I'm sorry this is a novel but I really don't know how to explain it succinctly, it's such an odd situation. I wish I could ever have normal people problems that aren't littered with additional messy layers.

I've lived in my apartment for 3.5 years with a one year lease that's been month to month. I love my landlord, she's been awesome this whole time. My college best friend moved in to the apartment below mine a year after I moved here. We lost touch in the decade after graduating (mid 30s now) but had reconnected virtually during the pandemic. Long story short we rarely engage with each other now and when we do it's unpredictably hot and cold. 

The awesome landlord wants to sell the house but first wants to redo some stuff on the first floor before listing it. In November she asked my neighbor ex-friend to move out by Feb 1st, more than the required 30 days notice in our lease agreements. My neighbor spontaneously decided they'll become a homeowner and buy this house so they don't have to move out. I was unaware of any of this until a couple weeks ago when my neighbor very confusingly asked if I would be moving out at the end of the month. 

My neighbor is \*clueless\* about so many things and this is no different. She ""assumed"" that because she was asked to move out that I was to. Her plan was to rent out my place for like 300-400 more a month (I am positively underpaying right now) because she can't really afford the mortgage. She already has her sister, who wants no part of this aside from her name on the form, cosign a mortgage loan because she doesn't have enough. 

As her friend, I tried talking some sense into her about it being a bad idea or to at least have a back up plan if it doesn't work out since she'll then have to move out quickly. She essentially told me it was an official done deal and that she doesn't want any advice or help from me because she ""put a lot of thought into this the past few months"". Later that day she texted me that she wants the upstairs ""cleared out by June 1st"". I suggested she not act like my landlord until she actually is. The next day I found out from my actual landlord that this ""done deal"" is actually just her getting pre-approved for a loan. I may be clueless about homeownership but like I said, she is \*c-l-u-e-l-e-s-s\*. 

Without too much detail, she may successfully buy this house and will as a result become my new landlord by law however no one aside from herself and her sister seem to have much faith this will happen. I know her enough to know how absolutely, positively, godawful, nightmarish her as a landlord will be so as a tenant I am hoping and praying it does not work out for her. As an old friend, I want things to work out for her, whatever that looks like. If she pulls this off, I feel bad for whomever ends up living here after me knowing what they'll have to deal with. 

Today, after a week of not speaking, I got a vague text from her that she anticipates people being at the house tomorrow and wanted to notify me (less than 24 hours in advance). I called her to ask who and found out it's inspectors and that our actual landlord was not informed of this. Unbelievably, I had to remind her that she is not my landlord, at least not yet, and thus cannot be letting anyone in or out of my place or giving me notices of any kind. I asked how she expected homebuyers who \*don't\* live in the building they are hoping to buy get into the house for inspections and that I'm pretty sure she has to tell the landlord this happening. She again got mad at me, told me she does not have to tell the landlord but that she would do so (for me) and hung up on me. 

I let my actual landlord know about this interaction and explained that if she herself tells me about this inspection I will, of course, oblige without issue. I usually leave the inner door to my apartment unlocked when I leave but will 100% be locking it tomorrow. I can't remember if I ever gave her a spare key to my place for emergencies (though it's unlikely she'd know where it is in the chaotic filthy mess of her apartment) but I'm a little nervous she has one and will let inspectors in anyway. I have no security cameras or anything but may leave my laptop up and recording when I leave for work tomorrow. 

If she does end up owning this place I will be moving out as quickly as possible while still giving the required 30 days notice because I want no part of this whatsoever but we'll still be legally tied together and I have a feeling she may decide to show her petty entitled side. At the very least she will have no freaking clue how to be my landlord throughout the move out process and I don't want to be responsible for explaining how it works or making sure things go as they should. I am so stressed out about this potential future and have no idea how to handle her acting like my landlord when she's not in the present because she is ""pre-approved"". 

This feels like the Twilgiht Zone. There is no internet advice around such a situation because this isn't the kind of thing that happens to people. If anyone has any advice for me I'm all ears. "
The-Unmentionable_19f9se9,"I imagine any place that’s half way decent and has both these things at or under $1,100 would require some sort of Battle Royale death match and the soul of an unborn child to acquire sight unseen so I’ve all but accepted it as an impossibility. 

After 4 years of going to a laundromat, I was *really* looking forward to finding a place with in-unit laundry. But I’ve also never had private outdoor space and have always dreamed of it. 

I’m seeing a place today near my current home (no major routine changes is a plus) that checks nearly all my boxes minus the washer drier. I’m month to month now and will have to move in the summer when apartment hunting is most cut throat and expensive. I’m really trying to avoid the whole “here’s 4 months rent now to secure my spot as me and 15 other potential renters look at it” only to hear someone beat me to *that* (it’s happened to me more than once so I’m speaking from experience.

So which would you choose if you could only choose one?"
The-Unmentionable_19biylf,"An idea popped in my head last night. Nothing serious but I am curious of the logistics. It’d be in a city where the homes connect on either side & nearly all of them are 2, maybe 3 stories tall though that’s slowly changing. 

The easiest way I can describe my vision is like having an apartment where the first floor is an open garage with no walls on the front or back end only the sides (assuming that’s necessary). Instead there would be some type of gate to keep the space private and some support pillars as needed. 

The open space could be used as a parking space or to maximize sunlit “yard” space, whatever. It’d be level and concrete, not raw dirt. A private stairwell inside would lead to the second story apartment, likely with a smaller 3rd story space leading to a roof deck area. 

I get that it’s silly as it doesn’t maximize the square footage of the lot which is likely why I have never seen such a thing but I’m still curious enough about the logistics to ask here. Thanks in advance for indulging me!"
The-Unmentionable_195rra6,"I’ve noticed this in past months too and am curious about it. My only guess so far is it’s a small meaningless glitch. As you can see in the image, some days are just black both in the past and the future. I underlined them in red here to avoid confusion."
The-Unmentionable_193equg,"I’m still new to the Sims 4 and still find certain aspects confusing. I’m a control freak player. Every lot, family, and storyline is carefully curated by me. I’m still navigating how to make different saves to avoid crashes while still keeping a seemless coherent multi world storyline. 

As a test, I had my second family attempt to visit the first family I created and noticed that both parents were away on a community lot. I’m fine with sims I’m not playing doing whatever in the world but I do not want any of their actions to mean anything when I do to play them next, if that makes sense. 

So now I’m wondering how these things interact. If I keep free will off, how do unplayed actions and events effect sims when you go to play them again? How should I be saving my gameplay to stay organized? 

For example if I want a child from family B to be best friends with a child from family A so I have them play together a lot and become BFF’s but a parent in family A sets their home on fire while I’m doing this, will the fire event still have happened when I go to play family A on the same save? If I keep the saves separate will I have to constantly double up on my actions (my the children BFF’s in save 1 and then repeat it on save 2)?

None of this seems very intuitive to me and is rather frustrating ATM which is obviously not why we play games so I’m hoping to figure it out soon!"
The-Unmentionable_18ldj75,"I recently started playing the Sims 4 and am just now remembering why I wasn't interested in playing it when it was first announced. There seems to be a much larger focus on the sims themselves with so many different traits and emotions. While I like this idea in general, my favorite part of the games has always been building and decorating the homes and businesses. Sims 4 seems to be really lacking in this area with a lot to be desired - a pretty big downgrade from the Sims 3 options.

I understand you can only fit so much programming in a game while having it still function and run well for the average user so I don't \*totally\* blame them for needing to pick and choose things to get rid of in order to try out something new. This got me thinking about the potential of 2 separate but adjacent base games, one for Buy/Build and one for CAS/Play allowing both base games space for a lot more possibilities and options. 

My thinking would be along the lines of building and decorating a home in the buy/build base game before saving a copy of it and exporting it as an unchangeable home to import into the CAS/Play base game. All the customization would be there, you just wouldn't be able to change anything about it while playing. This obviously comes with it's own set of difficulties to figure out but I think it would generally be the best way to give the majority of audiences most of what they love about all of the Sims games combined. 

For now, I'll be doing what I can with what I've got. I'm still enjoying it overall but it's not scratching my architect and interior design itch quite how I hoped it would. "
The-Unmentionable_18ld573,"The title is a bit vague but I'm curious if people here lean towards certain journaling behaviors or if there's a lot of diversity in our approaches. Also note that I'm new to the sub so apologies if this gets asked a lot. This question came about after a couple friends of mine shared some of their journal entry pages with me and I realized how differently they go about it from myself. 

Do you write in your journal every morning? Every night? Throughout the day when a thought occurs to you? Do you make dashes with a few words or write in complete sentences? Are your entries typically paragraphs long or short thought bubbles? Do you use separate sections for separate thoughts like dreams, memories, philosophical pondering, etc. or do you keep them all together in one space? How much detail do you record of your dreams and memories if you write about them? Do you refer back to previous entries ever or just let it out in the moment before moving on? Do you add doodles or keep it solely to writing? DO you add to-do things to your journals or keep those separate? 

I'd also love to hear your age and gender if you are comfortable sharing to see if there's any commonalities among certain groups! I am 33F and write most mornings in a traditional diary style with full sentences and occasional doodles. I've explored other was and would like to get more confident and comfortable with short hand but keep falling back to my usual methods. Both friends that I mentioned above are 34-45M who only write short hand with dash marks on an as needed basis (when they have a lot on their mind to sort out). 

Can't wait to hear how you keep up with yours!"
The-Unmentionable_18cgptu,"I graduated from undergrad school in 2014 and went on an IBR plan straight away. In 2016 I deferred them for a few months after being laid off from my second job a couple months after I moved out to live alone. Aside from that I have made every minimum payment in full on time. I made zero payments during the pandemic pause but resumed in September. I'm not sure the exact number of payments I've made so far but I'm sure I could find out. My minimum payments have generally been between $100-250 a month and are currently about $65 a month since repayment resumed. 

I recently got an email about the SAVE program and know based off my current income that I am likely to have a smaller payment if I switch from my current IBR plan. I also know on this plan that interest won't accrue on the principle balance the way it has been which could be. huge benefit to me long term. It's very painful seeing my overall student loan debt increase a few thousand dollars over the years due to interest being more than my minimum payments. 

My main concern is over the debt forgiveness point. Currently my loans should be forgiven after 20-25 years of repayment, of which I'm nearly 10 years into. With the SAVE program, it looks like every $1k beyond $10k of debt will add an additional year of repayment before forgiveness, if I understand correctly. I'm currently in $50k of debt. If so, switching to the SAVE plan would leave me with what, 40 more years of payments instead of 10-15? Even if my payments are $10 instead of $60 with the additional monthly interest canceling out each month, I'm not sure if the math would make it worth it, not how me paying more than the minimum on the SAVE program would affect the canceled interest from the minimum payments. For example, paying an extra $20 a month over the minus would be a waste if it goes towards interest that would otherwise be canceled instead of towards the principle balance. 

If anyone has gone through this math themselves and/or has a deep understanding of this and is willing to help me figure out which option is going to be better for me, I would greatly appreciate it. I do plan on calling them at some point as well to hear what advice they have for me but find things better to understand and absorb when they are written out vs over the phone. Thanks in advance. "
The-Unmentionable_189imwr,"I'll be honest, I save a lot of stuff and have been procrastinating making collections for them. I just went to start today and cannot find any saved posts beyond September 2023. I'm talking hundreds, possibly thousands of recipes, workouts, art, and architecture, seemingly gone forever. 

Did I miss some memo of them capping how may saves you can have or how long something will be saved for? Do dedicated collections have this same cap and/or time frame? Trying to move the few months of stuff I do have to a certain collection is also proving to be really messy. It seems that adding something to a collection from my saved posts keeps the post in my ""all posts"" category. Removing the post from ""all posts"" is also removing the save from my specified collection. Saving the same post directly to my collection also adds it to ""all posts"". What is the point of that? What gives?

I'm really just not sure wtf IG even wants me to do with it. They want me to comment, but not too much and without being too kind or too mean because then they temp block me for being a spammer or a bully (when ""you look great!"" is also considered bullying somehow). They want me to engage with the mindless feed but not be too interested in it because that's apparently too much for them to handle all those saved posts. They want me to post things but cannot even do the simple task of keep the original photo intact or do basic stuff to make posting stories and reels or whatever simple in the slightest. 

I'm really at a loss here. I'm pretty upset to see that all those saved posts are gone though. I'd start saving the images to my phone or computer but they \*also\* prevent that so...guess I'll just not do anything at all then? Idk anymore. "
The-Unmentionable_181o4kl,"I'm trying to catch an NJ Transit train at 9:45AM tomorrow morning from 30th St station. I would normally take the 17 route up 20th St and then walk or grab one of the westbound buses on Market. I see the Thanksgiving Day parade is starting around 8AM. It looks like it runs on 20th St & 16th St between JKF Blvd. and the Art Museum. 

Does anyone know if this bus route will be canceled or detoured until after the parade, specifically running north & eastbound (turning east at Market St.)? Unrelated random question, does 30th St. Station sell dramamine? I just realized I ran out and most stores are closed tomorrow."
The-Unmentionable_17z9wgv,"I stupidly had a fling with my late friends husband this past spring into summer. He asked if I wanted to hookup with him but made it very clear that he was not looking for a replacement wife or mother to his young son. We had a chat where I explained that I am emotionally unavailable, happily childfree, non monogamous, and only able & interested in a casual FWB situation with him (with occasional family outings like we did when my friend was still alive). We had chemistry but I always felt he was far too chatty for me and just, not my type. He seemed of sound mind when we agreed that this could workout well for both of us. 

What I didn't expect was for him to fall obsessively in love with me overnight and keep inadvertently trying to make me a wife and mother. It drove me nuts and I struggled to navigate the situation with the gentleness it deserved. Most of his friends and family do not live close but I live a few blocks away so it's easiest for him to reach out to me when he is lonely. We have become friends but my initial proposition to him hasn't changed on my end. I've tried a few different approaches to make this work but they haven't been very successful. His behavior reminds me of my most obsessive and least favorite ex more everyday. I don't want to grow to hate my friend and adore his child but it's heading in the direction of needing to cut all contact. 

I feel especially bad because a lot of what he does isn't inherently bad, it's just very incompatible with me and my life. Our schedules, our communication habits, our interests, almost nothing lines up. We have great deep conversations but I'm only so interested in that and he could go on repeating the same few big topics 4 days a week. He's at a point in his life journey that I went through alone in 2020 and I can't help but feel that he brings me backwards too much and that it turns into some teacher student dynamic I have little interest in. 

I've gotten to the point where I told him point blank I only want to see him once a month at most with minimal contact in between and he said he understood. That worked for a few weeks until we had an in person hang out and immediately he was back to texting me daily about how much he likes me and thinks about me, inviting me over daily, giving me pointless life updates, regularly bringing up mentally taxing reflective subjects, telling me not to worry about responding, apologizing for all the texts while not stopping. There are times I want to tell him something but I don't because I know I'll open the flood gates again. I want to be able to send him a single silly thing and him reply back and then merrily go back to our offline lives. 

I tried blocking him until I am emotionally up for a moment of enjoying his presence and appropriately dealing with him when he inevitably goes overboard but it made me feel too guilty. I do not use the ""read receipts"" function on my phone for a number of reasons ( I'm the friend that replies 3 weeks later unless it's important & my favorite people get it)  but think it could help the situation with him. My hope is that if he sees that I did indeed pick up my phone, look at his message, and choose not to reply that he will get the hint and back off some. The more he chills out the more he will actually get the time he wants from me. I wish he understood that. 

Am I being too hurtful putting read receipts on or just clearly getting my boundary and point across? If this doesn't work I think December might have to be the last time he has me in his life at all. I hope it doesn't have to come to that. 

TLDR: My casual FWB turned friend is obsessive over me and has no sense of communication boundaries. I've disrespected my own boundaries with him due to his fairly recent widower status but can't take it anymore. I still enjoy him on occasion and don't want to cut him out since I'm one of the few support systems to live near him but am running out of options. I hope that by turning on my read receipts, he will get the hint and back off so we can all get what we want but I worry it will backfire and just hurt his feelings and cause drama."
The-Unmentionable_17yceyj,"Sorry this post is long. I want to make sure I share as many relevant details as possible. Thank you in advance for seeing it through. 

My(33F) brothers (30M) current situation:

* Roughly 2k credit card debt
* 3 credit cards, all maxed out or close to it
* Interest for each is 29-36% + monthly and/or annual fees 
* Makes $800-940 weekly ($3.2-3.76k monthly) 
* Pays our mother $300 weekly ($1.2k monthly) for rent, car payment, and car insurance. *He moved back home in 2020 after 6 or 7 years on his own across the country*
* Roughly $500-640 weekly left over ($2-2.56k monthly) for spending and all other expenses
* Roughly 6-7k in federal student loan debt with monthly payments around $100
* Credit score in the high 500s
* No savings or very little savings  *I'm assuming & need to confirm this.*
* Other expenses include gas and medical marijuana. *Need to ask about anything else I missed*
* Flips various playing cards online which has been, to my understanding, successful more times than not
* Has borrowed $20-250 from time to time from me over the last 6 or 7 years. He's always paid it back in full at the agreed upon time, between 2-30 days. 
* He's used Solo Funds when he did not want to ask me for more with a high rating on the site for consistent on time payments in full with 10% tip to the lenders. 
* Will be getting a $600 holiday bonus from his job next month
* Will be getting surgery on his hand at the end of the month. *I am most concerned about this factor and am in the process of getting more info about it. I want to know the type of surgery and expected recovery time, what kind of income he will have during recovery, and what his plan is (without my help) if things don't go as smoothly as expected.* 

From what I can tell, he has the means, the drive, and the ability to get himself out of all this quickly. I am confident I can trust him to honor whatever terms we agree on while still being realistic about the risk I will be taking. I think he's simply clueless on basic money management, made some dumb financial decisions in his early 20s, and keeps making poor choices in an attempt to get himself out of this situation. I'm not wealthy by any means but I'm the only one in my family who's good with money so I want to help him \*but\* it's important to me that I not just bail him out. I want to teach him the skills he will need to be financially stable and responsible long term. I wouldn't be helping him if I did not believe he was ready to make this kind of change. 

With the information I was given, I crunched some numbers and mapped out a detailed draft of my terms of agreement, listed below:

* Taking $2.25k from personal savings to immediately pay off all 3 cards for a hefty flat rate fee of $1.05k ($3.3k total)  *I really struggled with this decision but ultimately found it to be appropriate. It's a middle ground between me saving him thousands long term without undermining the risk, time, and energy I will spending on working with him. It's also a less brutal tough life lesson than those horrific credit cards are punishing him with.* 
* He will keep the oldest card open & close the other 2.
* 6-8 month payment (his choice) with $550-412.50 monthly payments. Option of partial weekly or biweekly payments or full monthly payments.
* Option to credit the final payment or lower remaining payments via equal distribution if he chooses to pay more than the minimum monthly payment.
* Mandatory minimum of $150 of his monthly income will be put into a savings account to start or add to an existing emergency fund.
* Creation of a monthly paper or digital budget that includes a list of all bills, due dates, and method of payment. I will share my personal chart as a guide. *He is exceptionally great at paying individuals back on time as promised but keeps getting hit with late fees from companies. This will help him stay organized and on top of everything without feeling overwhelmed.*
* Where possible, he will charge his remaining credit card and treat it like a debit card to avoid any fees while responsibly rebuilding his credit score.
* Monthly phone or video chat to fine tune and solidify healthy budget and spending practices, share any relevant situational updates, work through struggles, celebrate milestones, and offer overall support. 
* I will continue to check in for another 3-6 months after being repaid in full. Depending on his continued money management success and current credit score, I will consider adding him as an authorized user to one of my cards. He will *not* have access to my card but my excellent credit and low utilization should give him and additional credit score boost. With that boost I will help him find a *good* credit building or rewards card and remove him as an authorized user on my own.
* I will offer guidance on paying off his student loan debt faster and/or increase his monthly savings at this time if he wants it. 
* After that he will be pushed out of my mentor nest and will hopefully fly high!

For peace of mind (and worst case to protect myself) a legally binding agreement will be written up and will include some form of reasonable penalization for not repaying in the agreed upon time frame. I haven't figured out what that would be just yet. My hope is to have it ready for him to sign over Thanksgiving. 

I do wonder what the best payment and repayment method might be for this (Check? Zelle? Venmo?). I'm trying to make this as seamless as possible for both of us and don't want to create an unnecessary tax headache or something if we can avoid it. If there is anything important I missed or haven't yet considered, please let me know! I've never done anything like this before.  

Thank you again kind readers for getting through all of that. It is very much appreciated. "
The-Unmentionable_17xgsc1,"I’m aware of how little I know in life. I’m away of how that is true of everyone. I don’t judge people for not knowing things. I don’t judge myself for not knowing something. I freely admit my level of knowledge and readily adjust my views when corrected. I respect those who can confidently differentiate between their  expertise, casual, and nonexistent understand of a topic. 

I struggle a lot with witnessing or hearing about those who act without any thought, lack curiosity about things pertaining to them, or choose to make the same ignorant decisions after learning more. 

On good days I just silently judge them and move along. On bad days it really eats me up that anyone is like this as it directly influences how difficult it is for me and those like me to exist on this planet. 

I try my best to only give advice when it’s asked for. I do fairly well with showing sympathy/empathy to those who need it. Depending on the situation I will drop a tidbit of helpful info. It’s increasingly difficult to not fall into my reclusive crab shell with my cat and be done with it all. 

And again, I don’t expect people to know things. I don’t know things either. But if they are not asking questions *before* jumping into something, if they aren’t reflecting and taking valuable knowledge away each experience, if they keep to their comfort zone even after acknowledging their behavior is ineffective/wrong/hurtful…I just have no respect left to give them. 

And it’s just to dang many people that fall into this category. How, how can I learn to keep these people around me without my brain cells melting out of my eye sockets on the regular? My poor teeth can’t take much more stress related daytime grinding. How can I improve on this?"

The-Unmentionable_17rnf4a,"I wish there were trustworthy stats on how many tickets are successfully VS unsuccessfully redeemed for events. I know people are more likely to tell their story when things don't go well so it's really hard to tell and I'm just immensely anxious right now. 

I had 2 tickets to a sold out event, listed 1 online that just sold for instant download. I really love this artist and saw a ticket much closer to the stage so after mine sold I bought the closer ticket also for an instant download. I just took a look at my newly purchased ticket and it does indeed look identical to the legitimate ones I purchased. It seems real as far as I can tell. 

I want to list the other ticket I originally bought but am hyper worried that I am about to screw myself over. That somehow even though everything looks legit, I'll end up being denied entry. I'll feel so dumb considering, in that scenario, I went from 2 real tickets to missing one of my all time favorite artists because of a scam. I don't get anxious often these days but my heart is pounding out of my chest at the thought of listing my only remaining 100% positive real ticket I bought myself during the original sale. 

So I'm wondering about if there are any behaviors or indications that a a resale ticket is a fake? For example, are instant download tickets more likely to be legitimate than ones they send you the day of a show? Things like that. I'm likely being paranoid & have (thankfully) never had issues getting into a concert but rarely use StubHub so IDK what to expect. "
The-Unmentionable_17r5yrm,"There is quite literally no recourse for this POS excuse for public transit. None. I’m at the point of seriously looking into the logistics of an illegal private public transit system because there is just no other options aside from spending hundreds a month people don’t have in personal car rides. I don’t really support privatization like that but I also don’t support a no function system. That’s not a system that’s a nothing. I’m sick of any and every mood I have from life being utterly ruined by Septa. 

Yes yes I know about the recent driver news. I can find that sad and gross and still have blood boiling rage at the system. The system is not the drivers. 

A few days ago, a Septa phone rep repeated to me 3 times on the phone that she was positive a bus was at the start of the route and would be at my stop on time in 40 minutes (the other one was 35 minutes behind schedule aka canceled at that point but that wasn’t reflected on the app of course. I did not trust her and started walking the 2 miles I have to do daily because of this BS. I spent most of the walk filing a complaint over said bus being 16+ minutes late sitting at the start of the route. The person I filed the complaint to naturally had no explanation for any of this and tired telling telling me to only use the Septa app as if that does jack shit (I was and always do because none of them make sense anyways, at they they can’t play out off when it’s their failing garbage. 

My peers are in the verge of getting fired because we rely on this to get where we need on time. When you can’t trust the app & you can’t trust the support line wtf else can you do!? I’m officially recording all time stamps, call lengths, what was discussed and getting names of everyone I speak to because that’s literally the only power I have but Jesus full it’s not going to do anything or change anything. 

I just want to choose violence at this point at least that feel productive. Maybe people would ride the damn transit system if THERE WAS ANY TRANSIT!! Now time to ice my feet and tend to my blisters after my 3.5 mile walk home at midnight to prep for my 2 mile walk to work tomorrow at 8AM. FUCK YOU SEPTA FUUUUCK YOU"

The-Unmentionable_17nnero,"My cat is pretty good with leaving my plants alone most of the time. Some he’s more interested in than others, like an English Ivy I recently got, but he doesn’t seem to mind my pothos and only likes my snake plants on days he wakes up with evil in his heart and decides to be a real turd monger as I like to call it. 

I am super, super broke so buying any supplies for shelves or anything to that puts them out of reach isn’t an option. Even if I found free supplies it’s an apartment I rent and the walls have been more difficult than most places I’ve lived to secure objects with any significant weight to them. Plus my cat is hella smart and as stubborn as me so he and knows why I put plants out of reach and makes it a personal mission to break anything and everything to show me who is boss. 

I swear he is typically the best cat I’ve even had the pleasure of knowing but we all have our hills we’d die on I guess. He’s the best. 

Anyway I know for sure lemon scents don’t bother him too much but he hates strong mint smells. He runs away when he gets a whiff of my toothpaste. I have some peppermint essential oil already and wondered if diluting it with water would be enough to keep him at bay without hurting my plants (pothos, snake, english ivy, & a momstera). Mostly curious about the plants safety and what the strongest dilution ratio I can safely use might be  since I understand all cats are different so no one can really say if a less strong scent will be enough. 

I’d especially love to hear from anyone with cats that sounds like my boy. Photo because he’s a cute little Stinker (named Stinky) and loves attention from people. You can feel how bad he wants it!"
The-Unmentionable_17k6nsd,"I'm confused.

When a friend texts me a TikTok link, I click it and the link opens in Safari and plays. 

When I google something on my phone in Safari and a TikTok video populates, it will not play the video. It tells me to download the app if I want to play it. 

I do not want TikTok. I'm not going to download it. Does this mean I can never watch a single TikTok video unless someone sends me the link to the video? 

I'd understand if it was all or nothing and I could only watch shared links with the app too but that's not the case. How can I watch TikTok videos in Safari when a friend shares but not when I find it myself?

Celery

The-Unmentionable_17h4r31,"For anyone who doesn't know, Fort Mifflin in Philadelphia has hosted the Making Time weekend event for 3 years in a row now. This past year, the event happened during the Tropical Storm Ophelia. The event still took place & I can attest it was a wet, muddy, and amazing experience. But we done fukked up those grounds in the process. 

Fort Mifflin simply cannot afford to repair the damages on their own so the Making Time crew has been doing all they can to raise money to repair the grounds. Fort Mifflin spokespeople said they would be happy to host us in the future (and may even kick off next years event with a cannon blast) IF we can get these grounds repaired. 

You can read a bit about it here: [https://edmmaniac.com/making-time-fort-mifflin-fundraiser/](https://edmmaniac.com/making-time-fort-mifflin-fundraiser/) 

So far, over 12k has been donated to the cause but we're not quite to the goal yet. I haven't seen anything about this posted here yet so I thought it would be a good idea to spread the word in case anyone, anywhere is in a position to help us out for the greater EDM community. 

They're hosting a number of events in NY and Philly with all proceeds going to the grounds but also have a page for donations here: [https://fort-mifflin.networkforgood.com/projects/205458-transcendental-terranova](https://fort-mifflin.networkforgood.com/projects/205458-transcendental-terranova) If anyone is able to donate anything at all, it would be much appreciated! 

To be clear I am not affiliated with Making Time or Fort Mifflin in any way. I am simply an EDM fan who attended the event and wants to help in any way I can, including spread this info. I'm hoping this is okay to post, I did not see any rule directly prohibiting such posts (it's not really a promo I don't think) though it's possible I missed something in which case, my apologies. 

Thank you to anyone who is able to help and I hope to see some of you there next year - ground repairs pending of course!"
The-Unmentionable_17h3frr,"My friend has a home garden and knows I like cooking though I'm not particularly skilled at it. I stick with fairly basic, simple recipes for the most part. Anyway, she gave me a lemon cucumber yesterday and well, I've never seen or heard of them before so I have no idea what to do with it. I love lemons. I like cucumbers. But what oh what should I do with it!?

For context, I almost always keep cucumbers on hand but currently use them in two ways...veggie & cream cheese bagels in the morning and on hummus plates with other raw veggies as a snack or dinner. I think it would be nice to use this in a different way, especially since I have some of my usual go-to cucumbers in the fridge already.

I googled lemon cucumber recipe ideas and basically got a bunch of basic salad and pickling variations. I'm not opposed to salad but it's not my first choice. I more open to pickling them but thought I'd ask you kind folks how you'd use them first.

I’m generally good with my financial planning which is largely why I’ve been able to stay afloat. 

Stocks are one area I feel pretty clueless on though. The only ones I know I have were given to me by my employer. I get RSU’s every year and a few vest each year I stay with the company (10 years in Feb).

I feel like it’s wasted just sitting there but I’m not sure what to do with it. I could move it to my saving account that earns slightly above average interest rates, reinvest it, put it in a CD type savings, or something else entirely. I just don’t know. They each have pros and cons, some on a more personal/psychological level than a generalized one but for now any basic advice or suggestions will be helpful.

If I place the order directly on the Five Guys website, is it still a 3rd party company delivering my order or is it a Five Guys employee? If it is a Five Guys employee, does the company keep the delivery fee or does the driver actually get that fee?

I asked him why he put it on low and he was just utterly clueless and amazed by me telling him that boiling water on the highest heat possible is the way to go.

The-Unmentionable_16nyle1,"This isn’t yoga specific. I’m a pole dancer but I also do yoga, aerials, HIIT, general stretching, conditioning, and mobility exercises among other active hobbies. 

I’ve had lifelong issues with a very weak low core (abs & back) for a variety of reasons. I made great strides with it since 2019 and was at what I’d call my current “peak” physical shape in September 2022, exactly a year ago. Even then I noticed one small section on my very low back and very low abs seemed to not have the definition the rest of my core had. 

Anyways I back slide a lot over this past year losing a lot of strength and putting in a bit of weight. The definition I had has taken a big hit so it’s hard to see exactly where that spot is at the moment (it’s so weak I can’t really feel it yet) but I digress. I’m not too worried about this, just trying to give some overall context.

Now that I’m back at it, I’ve noticed that my peers seem able to do some basic things I can’t. For example this morning, we were doing some pelvic tucks and tilts in a straddle position on the floor where we want to sit up nice and tall. My friend teaching the class as well as most of the students seemed able to lay their hands flat on the ground behind them in this straddle position but I *have* to tent my fingers if I want to continue sitting up tall without relaxing that tiny portion of my low core.

I’m wondering if part of the reasons it’s so weak is because I’ve been trying to live my life as if my arms are as long as other people’s. Or maybe it’s my torso that’s a bit on the longer side? I’m not sure and it’s not severe enough to be noticeable in daily life but it is causing some issues. 

There are times when the teacher will recommend using one’s hands on the ground to help prevent the low back from rounding out in certain stretches and strength conditioning moves. Right now I can only use my hands as support by rounding my low back but also lack the strength there to do the move *without* that added support and need up rounding my back anyways.

Aside from using blocks or continuing to tent my hands, are there any tricks an short armed peers here have found help them in their yoga practice? does anyone know of stretches that might help lengthen my arms a smidge over time? That sounds like a silly question but I know a body imbalance can positively cause one side of the body to be taller/longer etc. due to mismatched strength so I think it’s in the realm of possibilities.

My friend walked into a Planned Parenthood two Saturday mornings ago. She was able to get an STI test as a walk in and the employee asked if she’d like to take a survey for a $150 Visa card. She said there were also some signs around stating the offer. 

1 week later on a Saturday morning I go to the exact same location for the exact same thing. I’m first told they don’t offer walk-ins so I had to make an appointment for Monday. I ask about the survey & gift card and all the employees look at each other (I felt it was with annoyed knowingness but no way to say for sure). One employee said “let me message someone” but they have no other info before sending me off to come back Monday. 

Well a bank appointment that should have been 15 minutes long took over an hour so I had to call to reschedule my appointment. I again inquired about this offer and was told on the phone that there is no guarantee. That they have never heard of such a thing. That it doesn’t exist.

The-Unmentionable_16208fn,"To make a long, unbelievably wild and horrifying story short, I’ve been battling a take-out delivery addiction since the pandemic hit. There are so many contributing factors but I’m focusing on food for this post. I’m known in my friend and family circles as someone people seek financial advice from as I’m *usually* extremely good with money. This is out of character for me, embarrassing, and extremely difficult to overcome. 

But I’m trying. 

Finally, *finally*, last month I got serious about breaking this habit and making home cooking a  part of my lifestyle again. I actually miss and crave the idea of going out to eat as a special event instead of “dinner on a Tuesday” which has been helpful as I make this transition. Still, it’s been difficult to fight my daily urge to hit the bar, post up at my favorite coffee shops, or waste $50+  on $20 worth of late night delivery. 

To keep myself motivated and on track, I allocated a small budget for dining out or takeout (no delivery with fees so high). I’m trying to keep it to one outsourced meal every two weeks making what I got today my second take out order since I started. 

Originally I was going to buy a delicious tofu scramble hand pie from a bakery up the street. I’ve had it many times before and it’s very good however this place only has hot coffee and I was craving an iced coffee. I then remembered a local grocery store on that same block has iced coffees and does hot breakfast sandwiches on Saturdays only. Instead of stopping by both places I decided to try out the sandwich at the grocery store.

Unfortunately for me, while the sandwich is well made with great fresh local ingredients, I don’t really like it. It’s just disappointing and unappealing to me and I ended up only eating half of it. Now I’m bummed because I could have had something familiar and delicious but instead need to wait two more weeks to get a “redo”. 

It’s so silly but I’m pretty upset about it in this moment to the point I want to cry. I love trying new things and deeply miss having enough disposable income that thoughts like these didn’t occurred. I’d just go buy better food and give the uneaten food to a friend or homeless person. I miss treating people to good food. I miss money not being the top 3 thoughts in my head every waking moment.

The-Unmentionable_161drur,"I’ve been considering a SAD lamp for years now and every time I research them I see warnings about overuse of the lamp causing insomnia. It’s generally recommended that these lamps be used for 30-60 minutes per day to get the benefits without any negative side effects.

I understand that dawn and dusk are much dimmer light than midday so using a SAD lamp in the nighttime hours would mess up one’s sleep cycle.

The-Unmentionable_15kqrrm,"Skipping all the little details, I have a friend that loves the sound of his own voice and never shuts up. I mostly enjoy the topics we discuss but they are *far* too long winded, take up *way* more time than I want to spend in conversation, and leave me *completely* drained/stressed/irritated. 

I’ve done most typical social cue things to indicate I’m over a conversation and he does seem to notice it on some level but it does not stop him. In my weaker moments I’ve gotten so anxious listening to him that I’ve interrupted him to blurt out that “he talks to much” for me. He chuckles at this and will stop talking but then it’s just silence. If I try and break the silence I quickly find myself back where I started hearing his monologues. 

I like hearing his stories and perspectives but unless we hang out once a month with zero contact in between, I quickly get to a point where the moment I hear his voice I stop listening to protect myself from being drained and even that grows difficult. I’m socializing less overall because I need to so much alone time to recover that it’s negatively affecting my life. 

For reasons I’ll leave out, he could really use me as a regular part of his support system but I lean more towards going no contact every time we speak. I’m not the only person to mention this to him but from the sounds of it, other people take the polite route and hope he gets the hint (mainly work peers he manages so there is a power dynamic). 

I can’t really tell if he likes this about himself or not. I cannot tell if he is aware of the negative impact it has on (enough) people in his life or he’s oblivious. I’m not sure how much he would care if he did know how it affected those around him. 

I would like to ask him if this is a personality trait he likes about himself or not. I’m open to helping him correct his behavior if it’s something he wants to change. Otherwise I may have to prioritize myself and cut contact because I don’t feel it is my place to tell someone part of their personality is objectively good or bad. 

So what do you think? Is it appropriate to ask how he feels about the way he holds conversations or should I just stay quiet and make adjustments on my end as needed?"

I’m 32F and have been casually dating this 44M for I guess about 2 months now but have known each other since 2019. The past couple of weeks in particular, I’ve noticed myself being really distracted by thoughts of him and I know it’s a mutual experience as he told me the same (unprompted from me). 

I find it really unbelievably awesome in some ways. My mind and body haven’t felt anything like this with anyone before, at least not in the past 12 years. In other ways it’s extremely bothersome though, particularly when it comes to sleeping. I keep finding myself up well past my usual sleep time and regularly waking up hours earlier than usual & it’s the same for him even though we don’t engage with each other in those hours. 

I can’t speak for him but for me the intrusive thoughts specifically preventing my sleep are positively hyper focused on our bedroom fun. But seriously no amount of “taking care of ourselves” is working to calm the thoughts and I’m growing tired of being tired.

I’ve been cycle tracking since I started college and can only find a handful of cycles in all that time that lasted 31/32 days. Every other month has been in the 25-30 day range. Aside from having the copper IUD for a year in 2017 I’ve never been on birth control. My cycles have just been naturally predictable. 

Typically use condoms or the pull out method (with select men I trust). I was pregnant back in 2015 so I’m familiar with some of the early signs and currently don’t *think* I’m pregnant and two negative tests support that (the first was expired though so not fully reliable). I’m also nearly certain I’ve been experiencing PMS so that’s a good sign I’m not but I’m still a bit worried. 

I’m wondering if it’s possibly perimenopause causing the cycle disruption. I think I’m on the young side but not concerningly so. Are there any other reasons that could easily explain why this is happening? I’m starting to get anxious about it but know stress can make it’s delay even worse so I’m trying not to be!

Edit: I just had a massive A-HA moment. I got covid this past month and the delay is likely related to that.

The-Unmentionable_11z7bln,"I've been trying to figure out how many files I have on my Google Drive that are not in a folder. I can only find two ways to check for a number of files. One of the ways is \*only\* for files inside a folder so it does not work or apply to my situation. The other option is to scroll to the bottom and click the first and last file, to highlight them all. Sounds simple enough but it's not playing nice.

It just gets stuck in a scroll loop forever. I sorted the files by date modified to see what date I should be scrolling down to before reaching the bottom and saw a date for late 2016. However when I scroll from most recent to least recent it just gets stuck in 2017 forever. I could scroll for an hour and it just cycles between August 2017, September 2017, November 2017, and then back to August 2017. It never reaches the 2016 files. 

On the phone app, it does let my scroll to the end but only lets me select one file at a time so I cannot simply click the first and last file to see how many files are in my drive, not in a folder. There are far too many files for me to click on individually on my phone so that's not a realistic option. 

This has been going on for months so it's not a temporary issue. I'm not sure how to fix this but it's pretty valuable information for me to know how many files I'm working on organizing. Has anyone else had this issue or a similar issue? Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. It's growing annoying rather quickly."
The-Unmentionable_11uvzbe,"This is undoubted an “explain it to me like I’m 5” kind of thing. 

The vast majority of funds I held with BlockFi were GUSD. None of the funds were in a wallet, everything was in my interest account when BlockFi publicly shit the bed. 

All the info I’m seeing now for filing claims and such are specific to funds people had in their wallets. I have thus far assumed that there is nothing for me to do and it’s just money I stupidly loaned a stranger bum for his pool parties or whatever. 

So I just want to triple check that the only potential hope to see any fraction of funds returned to us is only applicable to those who had moved their funds to their wallets prior to BlockFi’s pause on transfers. That I might as well just delete the app and stop looking at money I’ll never see a penny back on.

Basically, there are a handful of men in my life that have romantic potential. These men run the gamut of ties to me from an ex turned FWB that I’ve known for over 7 years to a cute barista I don’t even know the name of but would like to give my number to. 

My first thought was to pull a card for myself and then one for each person but I have no idea how I’d interpret the cards from there. What kind of spreads do you think would be good to use?

I entered my 1099-NEC info and started to add the details of my “business” (my business being me) which I think is correct. The “business” address is my home address even though I only teach at the dance studio, is that correct?

I have paid for some pole specific online workshops, could I add those as deductions? What about HIIT, climbing, and yoga classes I take to learn & maintain a high base level of fitness, do they count as deductions? What Theragun purchase for post class recovery?

The-Unmentionable_10y782g,"I’ve never used a meal delivery service before but know they are pretty popular. I’ve seen various levels of eco friendly options in regards to their packaging and ingredients but none that could be considered zero waste. Is this something we may see in the future some day or are there obvious obstacles I’m missing that would make it a bad idea?

I’m thinking of some type of reusable containers that the delivery person would pick up at the same time the next order is dropped and/or some empty container drop off locations similar to an Amazon locker. To avoid customers hoarding the containers for personal use, there could be a reward program, discount, waived fee, etc. for any customers who successfully return all the empty contains. 

The main concern would be cleaning the containers for future use in a sustainable way. I’m far from an expert but I like to think there is a solution to that problem that’s better for the environment than the system that currently exists. I know some companies offer recyclable or even compostable packaging but to my understanding, reusable package is still a better option yes? 

Does anyone know of a company that does this already? Is this a realistic option? Do you have any good ideas of your own on the topic?"
The-Unmentionable_10r43oy,"I thought of this while watching recently and think it could help solve some of the imperfections of the show. I’d love to see the first 2 challenges be handled differently by breaking up the 100 contestants into subgroups. 

There could be maybe 3 subgroups of powerlifter physiques, gymnast physiques, and combination physiques. Something to that effect. Each of the first 3 episodes could focus on 1 physique type with two challenges specially chosen to show off the skills of each subgroup with half of each subgroup still being eliminated at the end of the second challenge. 

From there, they could introduce the gym and fuel space. They could also optionally have this be the first time the different subgroups see each other to cut down on how long they spent having 100 people watch each other enter the same room. This could be the point where the first group challenge is. It would add some difficulty and dramatic tension trying to select teammates when you haven’t even had a chance to watch contestants in the other subgroups perform yet. 

This would keep a more balanced level of subgroup physique types in the competition for longer. The later challenges could be things that utilize a balance of strength, coordination, and flexibility for a greater sense of who truly has the “best” overall physique. 

I found it slightly unfair that the first 1V1 challenge was so much easier for the stronger players, particularly the ones that chose significantly smaller opponents. It’s a solid tactic for a competition game show but I don’t think it properly leads to the top 50 having the best overall physique, just the strongest. If the first elimination challenge involved speed and agility over strength we’d have much different top 50 physiques in my opinion. 

Yes I know 3 equal subgroups wouldn’t add up to 100 but I couldn’t think of a good 4th subgroup. Maybe you guys have some ideas for that.

The-Unmentionable_10nrqwg,"I’ve been playing this game for years and solve most expert level puzzles I come across but I’ve never tried using any and advanced techniques. I’ve casually looked into advanced techniques but they don’t really make sense to me though I admit I am not spending a lot of time to really understand know they work. 

Recently I even tried a basic x wing and was unsuccessful with it. That one seemed pretty basic so idk what I was doing wrong but these techniques look so involved and require spare paper that it kind of just feels like a more complicated way to make a statistical educated guess and see how it goes. 

I usually fill the obvious squares followed by the obvious pairs. From there I notate all possible options for each square and assess the whole. I look for statistical likelihoods and find one that seems like it could help me solve the rest of the puzzle if I get that single square. I’ll mentally guess what it might be and the. Kind of work backwards in my head to see how far I’d get without a mistake by penciling in my guess. Once I get far enough and don’t discover any issues, I go for it! 9/10 times it’s a success. That 10th time I typically get it right in my second try. 

I’m *clearly* a casual player. I can hardly understand the language you use to describe your actions in this sub so apologies if my words make no sense. I joined this sun to learn how to never guess but it’s been hurting my brain and I’m not sure what I’m missing.

Right now, I am saving up for a big trip to Italy & Germany but am desperate to explore somewhere new. I’d love to go on a 4-5 day trip somewhere warm to escape this wintery drear but I keep getting stuck mentally. Many of the cheapest flights I see are for places I’ve been to before but did enjoy like Vegas, Florida, and Puerto Rico. Cheap transit is important because I don’t want to cut too much into my big trip savings.

I loved the nature around Vegas and would 100% have fun there again, I have a friend in Florida I could visit, and family in Puerto Rico. Opposite of warm but I also keep thinking about my 2018 extended weekend in Montreal and would love to go back. 

But then I think about my fantasies of seeing Colorado, visiting my friend in Texas, or another in Maine. I daydream about Portland and am curious about Charleston, Atlanta, you get the idea. 

So how do you choose? Do you prefer to revisit places you know you love or opt for a new destination each time? How does budget fit into your choices?"
The-Unmentionable_107p9g4,"As someone who very rarely gets things on my clothing, I’m pretty irked that a few hours into wearing a brand new shirt I accidentally got a small resin stain on it. It was in the shape of a small circle from the tip of a one hitter on the chest so it’s in an obvious spot. 

It’s an orange/multi-colored, 100% organic cotton t-shirt. A couple hours after it happened I tried using a tide to-go pen on it. That took some of it out but also seemed to mess with the material a tiny bit like it was weakening the fibers or something so I stopped. It then sat in my hamper for over a week and got washed in cold water but not dried.

The-Unmentionable_103cv11,"I(32F) met a guy at a bar about a month and a half ago. We chatted for a while at the bar and got into some good deeper conversations. We exchanged numbers and have hung out at his place a few times since then and out with some of his friends once. We haven’t even kissed so I’m not sure he wants anything romantic but my gut says he’s open to it if I make it abundantly clear that I’m interested. I’m not actively dating so I’m just going with the flow and getting to know him platonically first. 

Chess is one of the things we bonded over the night we met. I play casually online daily but have put next to no energy into studying the game. He mostly plays on a real board at his job between clients appointments. 

I challenged him to an online match and won! The next day over text he mentioned food I left at his place and I told him he could have it, joking that it was the least I could do after kicking his butt so hard in the chess game. He responded by telling me he was not impressed and thought I would checkmate him sooner but that he was looking forward to a rematch. 

A few days later I challenged him again and again won the game. Over text we confirmed plans to meet tomorrow to watch a TV show and play a physical game of chess. I again joked that I was giving him the benefit of the doubt that he stands a chance against me on a real board and to remind me again how he wasn’t impressed. He again responded that he was not impressed and told me I only won because he made a blunder. He followed up saying that a probably play a lot and am barely intermediate. 

I’m making it very clear that my words are playful in tone (with emoji’s and exaggerations and such) but he didn’t make it clear if he was being serious or not. It honestly read as being quite serious. I’m already put off by his words, but want to stay on a playful note without letting him put me down like that in case he’s being serious. 

I remind him that I am indeed a casual player who said when we met that I play a lot but almost never study the game and that maybe he should be impressed by my casual skills (of still beating him twice in a row in under 30 turns with ample material still in the board). I half joked that I’m pretty one has to win a game before they can start talking shit to their opponent. Again, I found a way to teeter a line between playful banter and “your petty put down games aren’t cute so quit it”. 

His response was that he’ll just pay $100 (like I did for the yearly membership) to talk shit to a casual with the eye roll emoji. I have a hard time interpreting that as anything but serious and instantly gave me big ick vibes. I know I’m talking a big game but I took care to phrase it in a friendly way and well…I *did* win both games! 

I really didn’t like how he brought up how much I spent on a membership that I haven’t really utilized since I first got it. Or how he is seeming more and more incapable of admitting that I just might be a better player than him, casual or not. I know how silly that sounds but I feel like it could be an indication of how he’d act in similar situations.

The-Unmentionable_zxkv8t,"I have two tarot decks, Stella’s Tarot & Santa Muerte Tarot. As expected, they have some differences between them and each stray from what I see online in some ways. The Stella deck in particular was a beautiful but frustrating first deck to own as it seems to utilize both Raider Waite and Thoth.

Is there a definitive order for a tarot deck, including the major arcana, suit order, and court card order? If so, do you usually follow the “traditional” ordering or do you follow the unique order of the deck you are using? 

Stella’s tarot has Justice as #8 & Miracle (Strength) as #11 similar to a Thoth deck. Santa Muerte has Strength as #8 & Justice as #11 as seen in a Raider Waite deck. 

Stella’s tarot suit order is “wands, cups, swords, disks (pentacles)” same as a Thoth deck while Santa Muerte is ordered “chalices (cups), pentacles, wands, swords”. Stella’s tarot also places the court cards before the numbered cards in each suit while Santa Muerte places the numbered cards ahead of the court cards.

My biggest confusion comes from the court cards. Stella’s tarot lists the court card order “knight, queen, prince, and princess” which follows neither the standard Thoth or Raider Waite decks. In contrast the Santa Muerte court cards are ordered “page, knight, Queen, king”. 

To further complicate matters, most info I’ve found online states that the “knight” in Stella’s tarot translates to the “king” in a standard Raider Waite deck however the symbolism in both my decks clearly has the knights on horseback, leading me to believe that knight = knight. 

If that’s the case though I am at a complete loss as to the other court cards. Like if Queen also = Queen, if the page = the prince or princess, etc. 

I overall think Stella’s tarot is more closely related to a Raider Waite deck over and is better interpreted as such but it’s extremely difficult to interpret when I’m not sure which card is which (I often look up card means alongside my personal interpretations so know what to search for is important to me). 

I’ve paired up each suits court cards in the decks respective ordering in the attached photo to illustrate what I’m talking about and hopefully help get the clarification and suggestions I’ve been looking for for years! Apologies if I’ve used the wrong flair, I wasn’t sure how to categorize my post."
The-Unmentionable_zvtvxj,"Are there any go to spreads you turn to at the turn of each year? Do you have one spread that encompasses the previous year and approaching year or do you have separate spreads for looking back and forward? 

I missed doing any going into 2022 but I very much enjoyed the New Year spread I did at the start of 2021. The spread involves 1 card for each month, 1 card for the coming years theme & 1 theme clarification card. 

I like it because it was fun to look back at the end of the year and see how the events of each month lined up with the cards I pulled. The downside of this spread is that it doesn’t reflect on the year that’s coming to a close which is something I’m interested in doing.

But these 7-eleven chicken wings & bones drive him mad! He will do anything to get at them and I have to put him in a separate room if I want any peace while I eat. I’ve gone so far as to put the bones in a paper box inside a plastic bag inside another paper box inside another plastic bag inside my small lidless garbage can beneath other trash and I *STILL* come home to a mess of trash and bones scattered across the floor. 

Now I stopped eating food from 7-eleven 5 years ago at this point but a thought recently occurred to me, hence this post. Is it possible that he loved those wing bones so much because it’s what he ate to survive as a kitten and young cat Philadelphia has a very bizarre issue of chicken bones littering our streets. I’m wondering if my furbaby’s home turf was nearby a 7-eleven and those bones remind him of his kittenhood.

The roach flew out of my shirt again and I pulled the shirt down to stop it from returning. The roach then targeted the open sleeve of my t-shirt. I pressed my arm tight against my side but the roach managed to wedge itself in my armpit. I could hear and feel it flying aggressively trying to get back inside my shirt. If I moved my arm at all, the roach would have gone back through the sleeve opening.

A woman calls us and is a bit upset about  some charges she was seeing on her account. I ask her a few questions and realize these charges are coming from a completely different company! I explain that I work for company A but the charges in question sound like they are coming from company B. 

She is confused by this and I honestly don’t know how else to explain that if the charge on the account says “B $50” and I work at “A”, that I can’t help her at all because *I don’t work there and we are in no way affiliated* but I do the best I can.

I’m(32F) unfortunately stuck with them until late tomorrow night and I’m being civil for the time being but I’m done. 

I always knew how they treated me was different than anyone else in the family but after all the therapy and self growth I’ve gone through the past two years, it’s never been so painfully clear that they suck all joy and energy out of me.

And yes I tried having every version of a making amends or gaining perspective conversation with them but got nothing but blame for the way things are. No amount of “I feel” sentences help.

My request to be spoken to as an adult before this trip turned into a tantrum where my mother hung up on me and told me I could pay for my own hotel room while the rest of the family stays in another because she wants to have a nice trip and will definitely talk to me that way and not bother trying not to. Later that night she texted that she wanted to act like the conversation never happened and told me she will not have a conversation about it ever, even if I wanted that. 

The entire trip has been filled with small comments to me like how if my mothers doctor says her heart tests come back abnormal it’s (in an aggressive tone and tense glare)”because of me” before she adds a quick (smiling now) “just kidding”. 

I have not been able to make a single choice of my own all weekend, including what lights are being turned on or off, blinds being open or closed, where I sit in the car, etc. 

At one point the entire car was joking about my dad’s driving but when I chimed in my mother turned around and told me to “shut the f*** up or she will kick me the f*** out of the car”. I have very little recourse aside from taking the verbal abuse but, shaking to control myself I asked if my dad could stop the car because I wanted to get out. He stopped and as my brother moved to let me out from the center seat she spit “yeah let the b***h the f*** out of the car”. This is actually one of only 3 times I’ve ever heard her curse. 

A few hours later she acts like nothing happened. When there was a chaotic moment and I was feeling overwhelmed I sat and put my fingers to my temples and my dad asked what my problem was.  I said nothing and he told me I have problems. I told him “I know, I’m the only one in the entire family who has any issue” to which both of my parents openly agreed.

That was my final straw. I sat up and calmly said it’s okay, they won’t have to deal with me anymore after this trip. 

And I’m being serious this time. I’m going to tell them why I am making this choice and what I need from them before I consider letting them be a part of my life again so that there is no confusion, when I can mentally do so with a neutral tone. Until then, they are down a child.

I have many casual friends but no one I can have intimate conversations with, feel physical affection with, or simply share my life with right now. For this reason I’ve been talking to my own mother a lot more and it’s extremely unsatisfying. 

I always craved that Gilmore Girls level mother daughter bond and have had the misfortune of growing up watching my sister have just that with our mother. They look *freakishly* alike, talk multiple times a day, basically cuddle in photos together and are over all BFF’s. I on the other hand feel uncomfortable touching my mother in anyway, we have next to nothing in common, and she literally tries to get off the phone with me as quickly as possible when she answers at all. I don’t like reaching out to her but have such limited options right now of people who will accept all parts of me. 

I still *really* want what my sister and mom have though. A mother who has a lot of shared interests as me. One who is happy to see me and talk to me. One who I don’t feel like I’m bothering and who bothers me. This community is wonderful for one off situations but still lacks that one on one, IRL connection. I love you all but you can’t exactly sit with me and stroke my hair or give me a long hug after an especially difficult week you know? 

This is just along winded way to ask the question in the posts title, does anyone know of any place I can “adopt” a real life mother and they can adopt me (informally obviously, not actually adopt me lol)?"
The-Unmentionable_x454dq,"I know that the personality and lifestyle changes that happen when healing or growing will inevitably cause shifts in my social circle. Some people will take on a more casual role in my life, some a more intimate role, and others will end up completely fizzled or cut out. 

Over the past 5 years I’ve been inching my way towards changing my life for the better but started taking it *much* more seriously in the past year. So much has changed since I made this intentional shift in mentality. The journey will never end but I do feel like I’m on the cusp of being proud of who I am as a whole person for the first time in my life. 

As most of you know, it has not been an easy path. I currently have a plethora of casual friendships and acquaintances that I value. I don’t think any of them have much potential to become close ties but I appreciate what we bring to each other’s lives.

That said I still feel lonely and isolated a lot of the time. The handful of people I considered myself close to have been completely cut out of my life. Sometimes it was me that cut the tie, sometimes them, sometimes it’s been a mutual sentiment. 

I’m aware of my role in these relationships ending, typically in my poor emotional reaction to their toxic behaviors. I know that emotional reactivity can be toxic and the best solution I have for now is to distance myself from anyone close to me who treats me poorly until I’ve gained better skills on handling my own reactions. 

As I look around and see the very last of my close relationships come to an end, I can’t help but feel like I am the sole issue and they are all right to not want to be around me. Is this a sign of growth or am I just a toxic person who’s on the fast track to becoming an abusive hermit? 

I want to believe that some time alone will lead to the kind of close relationships I’ve always dreamed of but some days I’m not sure which path I’m really on.

Edit: 
To avoid spending all afternoon giving personalized responses (trying not to be glued to my tech these days), I’m going to give a blanket response here.

Thank you all for your comments. Even when I know the truth, it’s hard to keep in mind all the time. I don’t dislike *most* of the people who aren’t part of my life anymore and I want the best for them. Shared trauma, substance abuse, lack of boundary respecting, and plain outgrowth are all applicable in my case depending on the person I cut out. 

I’m already making many new casual friends through hobbies that lift me up and make me feel good so I do see a lot of hope around a new life. As mentioned earlier though I don’t see these people becoming very close to me as many of them still base our shared hobbies around not being sober while doing it. 

I have nothing against using substances but I want to be mostly sober in life and need that in order to be my best self. I’m still waiting to find people who are happy to be sober for a days/weeks on end while still open to the occasional happy hour drink or shared joint at a concert. A group that enjoys being athletic together, understands my humor, and makes me feel safe and at home around them. 

I know it will come eventually. Patience is not always easy for me though. Thanks again for letting me know that I’m not alone."

I buy them by the handful when I see them but they’ve been sold out my last two grocery trips. It’d also be nice to make large portions so I can freeze them as grab & go burritos or portioned out bowls!"
The-Unmentionable_wef387,"Edit: it’s written in the last sentence but I’d like to reiterate it here. I do not want or need advice on my situation. I can’t reply to everyone so I’m just going to ignore the comments giving unsolicited advice. I’m only looking for personal accounts and experiences thanks!  

I’m wondering if anyone here’s found someone they connected with in a period of time where you weren’t interested in a serious relationship, agreed to keep seeing each other casually, and decided to pursue an exclusive relationship with them once you felt ready for one? 

I’ve been casually, non-exclusively, seeing someone for about 4 months now. 2 months in, I brought up that I(32F) was open to exploring something serious with him(32M). He said he is currently not looking to enter a relationship with anyone. We agreed that we’d like to continue seeing each other casually. 

I’m enjoying my time with him and enjoying my freedoms to explore other connections. I do still see strong LTR potential with this person in ways I’m not with anyone else I meet. I’m not comparing others to him, just objectively not seeing such potential with other people I’m meeting and dating. 

I’m not completely sure where his head is currently at. We haven’t had another discussion about any of this since that one talk 2 months ago. I think I can safely assume he feels the same way he did then or possibly even less of a connection. I generally avoid assumptions but want to be realistic about the situation without making him feel that I am need a LTR relationship with him. 

I’m working on how to best approach a check in with him but in the mean time was curious about the outcome of other people’s similar situations, particularly from the perspective of those who originally did not want a relationship with anyone.

For the record, I believe it’s possible to meet someone you’d consider a LTR with at a time where you choose not to seriously date anyone for personal reasons. I don’t believe that 100% of the time the person will enter a relationship with “the right person” when they meet them even if they were not interested in a LTR. Sometimes the unspoken “not with you” is true but not always. 

I’m looking to hear about your personal experiences, not get advice thank you!"
The-Unmentionable_va53l4,"I am very go with the flow in the beginning stages of dating someone and am not bothered by a lack of conversation around what our intentions are or what we want out of the experience. 

Typically around the 3 month mark, I start to wonder where the other persons head is at and will bring up that conversation regardless of if I’m interested in something serious or keeping it casual with them.

Without fail though, once this conversation happens and we establish a desire to keep things casual, the dynamic changes for the worse IMO. They suddenly cut back on initiating texts, give shorter responses when I initiate, ask to go out less often, etc. 

It’s frustrating when it happens because part of why I liked my casual time with them was the attention I was getting and the fun flirty dynamic. Once they pull back I’m far less interested as it’s hard to maintain a connection when I’m the only one putting energy into it. 

I’m fine being an ego boost for someone as long as they’re cool being just as much of an ego boost for me! It feels like once I have that check-in though, I lose out on the behaviors that were making me feel good with them in the first place.

Do you just make sure to ask about intentions early on even if you are okay with things going in any direction? Do you just say nothing and have fun in the gray area until you decide you are no longer interested in them or in the casual nature of the relationship?"

For whatever reason I chose to open it that day. There was almost nothing inside except for a dog that looked kind of like a St. Bernard but smaller. About the size of a border collie. 

It was quickly accepted that the dog survived by eating the knick knacks in the armoire over the course of the year. The dog casually exited the armoire, unphased and friendly.

It's a bummer I can't watch a video to make it happen & the older I get, the less it's been happening. Mainly because people in the US touch each other much less as adults than as children (a sad truth IMO).

The-Unmentionable_q59z4w,"I'm an assistant instructor for intro level classes at my local pole studio. The studio will be moving to a larger space in spring and the studio owner wants all current assistants to be instructors by then! Aside from instructing Intro classes, I'm interested in leading some freestyle classes. More specifically, I want to target people who are not only new to pole, but new to physical activity in general. 

I started my pole journey with no fitness or dance background whatsoever and recall freestyle and flow being especially difficult. My mind body connection was weak, I felt silly and embarrassed by my body and it's movements. It was more of an emotional challenge than a physical one. I remember tearing up in nearly every  freestyle class I took either because I felt frustrated by my bodies physical limitations or emotionally overwhelmed by the moments my brain, body, and music found harmony. 

I want to help people like me find freedom and confidence in movement that is authentically their own. I want to help them unlearn traditional ideas of what is sexy and help them love the body they possess. I want the space to feel safe for self exploration while maintaining a strong sense of community with their peers.

I have no formal training or certifications on leading a fitness class (aside from a an awesome training course the owner gave all instructors & assistants for leading intro classes) but would be open to learning. I'm unsure of if this would be best as a ""regular"" freestyle class or if it should run a little differently (I'm not even sure what that would look like!)

I'm hoping to get some tips, tricks, and advice on making this idea a reality by spring. I'd love to hear what you liked, loved, hated, or valued most from freestyle classes you've taken in the past. Help me make this dream of mine a reality!"

The-Unmentionable_o4ugen,"I had the misfortune of fracturing or breaking my pinky toe in the first few weeks of the pandemic (April 2020) and was unable to see a doctor. I was roughhousing in the basement and must have landing on my foot oddly. 

I tried not walking on it but otherwise had no tape to wrap it or any way to help it heal. Eventually it stopped hurting has a slight bend to it. I can try & get a photo later if that helps but for now, imagine the nail of the pinky toe tilts outward slightly with the toe making a semi ""C"" shape instead of straight up to the sky.  

By August I was able to see my primary care physician but there was no pain or swelling by then. My doctor told me there was nothing to be done at that point. I've largely had no issues with it since but it definitely does not bend or function as it used to. 

In the past few months, as life has been ramping up again, I've felt mild pain and discomfort in this toe and it looks a bit swollen when there is pain. It goes away after a few days but I'm concerned about what that means.

Is this just something I will have to deal with for the rest of my life? Am I risking injuring myself further by continuing to do nothing? Is there anything I can do to resolve this issues now, over a year after the initial injury?"
The-Unmentionable_nvxp03,"I’m not gonna sugar coat anything so this post is gonna sound a little TMI but I can’t be the only one so here it goes...

I’ve been pole dancing for about 2 years now and have some issues that are becoming increasingly frustrating as I progress. In short, I feel like my crotch is trying to sabotage me! 
I have a skin disease that makes shaving that area a terrible, terrible idea so I try to keep hair there short but definitely let it grow out (due to pure laziness) between trimmings. Most days this doesn’t, bother me much but I do feel a little self conscious about it at times. 

Hair aside, it seems like every pair of pole bottoms I own expose one of my lips *every* time I spread my legs open. I’ll do a single invert and have half a hairy lip hanging out for the rest of a combo. I currently own mostly high waisted bottoms designed for pole dancing with a wide crotch and cannot even fathom what would happen down there if I wore any of the smaller thong type bottoms (even though I’d like to). 

The bottoms definitely fit but I would not say any of them are tight on me. Is it possible that the size is too large? I worry that going down a size will cause a muffin top or weird thigh bulges and/or make my flashing issues worse. I do have one pair of tighter, low rise bottoms with a middle seam and they don’t ride up but definitely cause a massive camel toe and expose my lips in combos. I want to start being about to wear different style bottoms that give me more skin exposure but I feel like it’s not in the cards for me unless I can get comfortable with my lips going rogue on the regular! 

I don’t like how it looks in my recordings and I get self conscious about it when an instructor is coming over to help me with moves where my lady bits are at their eye level. No one has every said anything to me about it because my local pole community is amazing but it *is* one of the reasons I’m hesitant to start posting my progress online. If anyone has experience with similar issues and was able to find a solution, I’ll be forever grateful for the shared info."

Part of why I am making this guidebook is because I want to coherently blend my personal interpretations of the cards with the generic interpretations I've been looking up on the internet. 

An example could be the colors or elements attached to a particular suit.

The-Unmentionable_fw2anf,"I'm 29 years old, am 5'5"" and currently 140lbs. I have been obese most of my life, reaching my heaviest point of 215lbs at 18 years old. This weight very slowly came off over the past decade and has remained at 140lbs for the past year or so. 

I have felt like something was off in my body for some time now. It was mainly a mere curiosity in my life until I got into physical fitness, specifically dancing. I am unsure of the cause and clueless on how to protect myself from injury.

Due to my uncertainty of the root cause of my ailments, I'll try to list any specifics that may be relevant from the most recent backwards. If anyone has some insight as to what could be causing this (assuming it's all due to a singular issue) I'd love to hear it.

DETAILS:

- I feel like the entire right aide of my body is offset from my left side as of a week ago. If I lay in a happy baby yoga pose and sway left to right it feels like my spine is in line with an area rug edge with my left side on the flat wood floor and my right side on the rug. It does not typically hurt but it effects my balance while on my back. 

- My right hip has felt stiff for as long as I can remember and most any stretches for getting into splits where my right leg is forward and my left leg is backward cause discomfort in my right hip. This has traveled down to my right knee as I know experience discomfort in ""easier"" but similar stretches to to the ones that hurt my right hip. 

- When trying to stretch my toes pointed, my left foot has made progress towards a ballerina type bend but my right foot locks up awkwardly. I'll bend the foot and my toes kind of bend inward towards each other before abruptly locking up. It feel almost like like the beginnings of a charlie horse in my foot when I'm activating these muscles.

- I have difficulty with some mild incontinence during certain periods of my cycle and was told by my doctor that it most likely was related to my pelvic floor. About a year ago she referred my to a physical therapist to help strengthen my pelvic floor but I put it off as I couldn't afford it at the time. 

- Both of my knees could always bend further back than most peoples. I just learned a few months ago that this is called hyper extended joints and can be detrimental to my overall physical health. 

- I constantly have very tense and knotted up shoulders near the nape of my neck, especially on the right side. 

- Before I started any classes or conditioning, I noticed that if I lie flat on my back, my left shoulder will rest flat on the ground but my right should is angled upwards a bit. 

- Since childhood, I could easily put my left hand between my shoulder blades (elbow down) and grasp it with my right hand (elbow up) but doing the opposite (right elbow down, left elbow up) was really uncomfortable for my right arm. The muscle on the outer part of my upper right arm feels really tight and my joint there will click and/or strain if I try and adjust my arm to alleviate the muscle pain. I've been doing this stretch for about 20 years yet the muscle hasn't stretched or loosened up at all.

- My entire life I have had this odd looking bone jut out a bit from the center/right side of my chest plate. My younger brother has this as well. It causes no pain and is more just something my partners ask about when they feel it. 

- I have been told that as a toddler, I randomly started keeping my right arm bent next to my body and refused to use it for anything. I held it as if my right arm was in an invisible sling and started using my left arm for everything. My parents took me to a doctor who said everything looked fine and that they should just force me to use my right hand and arm so they did. 

- I recall my family poking fun of my posture in my late prepubescent years, specifically my mother pointing out that it looked as if I was purposefully sticking my lower gut out but that was just the stance that felt most comfortable and normal to me at the time. 

Those are the only possibly relevant details I can think of right now but I'll add anything else I remember into an edit. To me, this feels like a problem with my bone structure and alignment than anything to do with my muscles though I'm not sure that actually makes any sense. 

Regardless, it is starting to actually effect my life and I'd love to figure out what's wrong so I can address it before I sustain any real injury, especially as I am stuck taking virtual classes from home and currently lack any IRL opportunities for an instructor to assist. 

Thank you for reading and I hope someone might have some insight for me!"
The-Unmentionable_fvkj1c,"I'm not saying people should not go on their computers. I truly don't care if someone loves playing video games or binge watching TV in their free time, that's perfectly fine. 

But if you have spent 8 hours of your weekdays working at your computer followed immediately by 8 hours of video games, social media, and youtube followed by a solid 12 hours of the same activities on weekends (after a 12 hour sleep), its a massive turn off and it's high time to find a hobby or two that take up time away from the screens. 

This isn't even factoring in the phone screen time, doing all the same things that were being done at the computer. 

I say this as someone who got a BA in computer 3D modeling and for most of my life did nothing outside of watch TV. I was a boring person then and I'd still be a boring person now if I kept that up. Give your body and mind some more variety than switching apps."

I have some basic sewing skills and a pair of really wide legged pants (looks like a maxi skirt when you stand and walk) that have been in the back of my closet forever.

I really love the print still but the pants themselves are not really my style. I expect this will be a big fail as I imagine this type of thing takes more skills than I have right now but I bored at home and okay with the idea of failing miserably in the name of fun and experimentation!

I was wondering if anyone here could guide me to any good sites and/or provide ant tips or tricks for me to try my hand at making myself a dress with all this fabric from the pants. I can gladly provide any info or photos you think would be helpful."
The-Unmentionable_fpfz49,"My last pole class before the studio closed was on March 16th so about a week and a half ago. As of right now they are hoping to open back up by April 7th but that is obviously subject to change.  

Thankfully they have been offering virtual classes so I have been taking some stretching and conditioning classes but cannot join the pole classes as I do not have a home pole right now. 

What can I expect going back in after a month off the pole assuming I keep taking the virtual classes I have the appropriate equipment for? 

I was on the cusp of getting my inverts and was just beginning to feel that climbing was not an utterly draining activity and fear I'll be ""restarting"" with a lot of that by the time I het back.

Will skin I already built up need to be reconditioned?  Will I forget where to put my hands and such for moves I was decent at before the closure or is it
more like riding a bike? 

I'm obviously overthinking and worrying about this more than I probably should. It took me 29 years of life to find some type of physical activity I enjoy and I'm scared that, at only 6 months in, I'll be discouraged enough to self sabotage my way out of pole once I'm able to het back in the studio."
The-Unmentionable_fe1c5u,"I'm going to ramble a bit below but the basic info I'm looking for is how your pole attire fits your body. Is it better to have a piece slightly dig into your skin and cause mild bulging or have a piece that you can easily slip a couple of fingers in at tue waist without issue? Do you care more about how it fits in the legs or the waist and why? Would a smaller size top help if your swimming in the cups or would it just make the waist tighter with the same cup issue? 

I know it's hard to discuss and every body is different but any info is much appreciated! And now commence my online shopping and sizing ramblings for ultimate details if you're interested...

I just got a bunch of new pole clothes in the mail and am really excited as it's my first pole related purchase since I started 6 months ago. My running shorts have been overused so much that they have basically disintegrated! 

I'm struggling a bit after trying them all on for fit as to weather or not I should return some pieces for a smaller size. I have lost a decent amount of weight this past year and still struggle with not grabbing L/XL instinctively. 

In plain clothes I've been fitting size M (10-12) for most brands. Some tops I end up getting a S but others a L. I'd say my size is ""average"" at least for my area in the Northeast Coast of the US. 

I measured myself and made purchases based off Pole Junkies suggested sizing while also referencing the brands official sizing when I could find it. I bought mostly Luna pieces if anyone has personal experience with them. 

I bought most pieces in a Large size as that was listed as the equivalent of a US size 10. The bottoms seem alright but I can easily stick a few fingers between the material and the waistband without needing to stretch it much. I'm worried that means they're too small but don't want to exchange them and realize the smaller size is too tight. 

The tops are more problematic because, while I don't have a tiny waist, I am very nearly flat chested. The sizing charts didn't address bra or cup sizes *at all* so I had to guess. About half of these I already know are too large in the bust...one has a literal gap between my skin and the fabric if I move at all! The bands around my torso could be a little tighter but again, I worry that the next size down will be too tight.

I'm trying to avoid paying shipping to exchange anything only to have to do it all over again. I almost never buy clothes online for this reason but I couldn't find *anything* I liked shopping in actual stores. Obviously I'm a little over the top with my anxiousness about fit but I'd love any first hand experience that could give me insight!"
The-Unmentionable_fbobf5,"I am not particularly looking for advice but I want to just say this somewhere and am not aware of any more appropriate sub.

This just seems so intensely childish to me I can't help but laugh though it's simultaneously upsetting.

Without going into details, I(29) met this roommate through my BF(29) and at some point we moved in with his best friend (33). The living situation was great for a long while but eventually tensions built up and there was a major falling out.

She and I are not on speaking terms anymore which is neither here nor there for me at this point. Throughout everything I made it *very* clear to my BF that I did not want to break up their friendship, I just did not wish to live with her any longer. They still text each other and I can here them chatting and playing games together on occasion so I'd guess that things are mostly fine between them.

I'm sure there is some level of awkwardness that they haven't addressed since she originally thought I would be moving out so they could remain roommates but decided on her own to start making moves to leave when she realized I would not be removing myself from the situation.

This awkwardness is most obvious when she enters the common areas where my BF and I were hanging out. My BF will say hello to her and ask her about her day and she will act like he is a ghost. No eye contact, no words, no nothing. It just feels so bizarre to me.

I know this is the case because one time I was on the couch with my BF and momentarily got up and was obscured from the view of the front door. She happened to come home in that moment, my BF said hello and she casually started chatting with him until I rounded the corner at which point she immediately stopped and ignored him and I both.

It just.so.silly.

TLDR: My roommate ignores her best friend (my boyfriend) when I am in the room after she and I (as roommates) had a major falling out and or no longer on speaking terms. I think that's childish AF."
The-Unmentionable_fajyg0,"I spent half my day today just being mad at my partner and the other half being sad that I felt mad about such a thing. 

About a week ago I was looking at apparel on Bernie's Campaign site because I was interested in buying one and donating to the campaign. My BF sat next to me, saw me looking, and ended up trying to buy us both a shirt. It was late at night and apparently the store was ""closed"" so we couldn't complete the order. It quickly left my mind and I found myself silently wondering yesterday if we actually order the shirts or not.

I got my answer today when my BF texts me from work to say he got himself a shirt. He was scared they would sell out so he just went for it he said.

Now I get that this isn't a big deal and under normal circumstances I'd have just ordered one for myself and maybe one for him too (as was my original plan anyways) but our relationship is far from normal and far from happy or healthy. 

All I could focus on was how he took an idea that was originally my own, did not consider me or my wants, and proceeded to immediately boast about it to me. So he couldn't comprehend that I would maybe possibly still want the thing that was again, my idea, but immediately thinks of me after the fact. 

Knowing that if I attempted to express mild upset by this I'd be told that it's not a big deal and I'm overreacting due to a shirt purchase is such a major turn off and I have zero interest in this cycle anymore. He is only capable of seeing the superficial issue, never the underlying problems I've been trying desperately to work on for the past 3 years. 

I also have ADD so I know the extreme amount of work it takes to improve the most simple behaviors but that also means I know what is possible. I forgot my meds today (something he won't try again) so I've for sure been especially on edge but my exhaustion and disappointment for our relationship feels too great most days. 

And that blows because he is exceptionally lovely when you don't need to rely on him in any of the ways a person might need or want to rely on their partner."
The-Unmentionable_eqspl0,"Just read a post about a woman who was pro-life until the moment she had a pregnancy scare and within two days did a complete 180 and is now pro-choice. She wasn't even pregnant, just had a scare.

Now don't get me wrong, I am truly happy she and seemingly her husband now see the light. I'll take all the supporters and converts I can but seriously though,

Can people just...oh I don't know...*fucking pretend* they've experienced *anything* they're against before    passing ugly ass judgement?

Yes I get it, you are on birth control *and* use condoms every time so what. Just fucking pretend. *Pretend* the condom broke and your birth control failed.

""Impossible!"" Yeah yeah sure, I know. But just pretend will you. If you considered seriously what you'd do if faced with that decision, I mean really seriously considered it, the world would be better off. 

No, don't reason away your need to put yourself in their shoes. I don't care if you are saving yourself for marriage. Fucking pretend! I don't care about XYZ reason on how this would never happen to you but anyone it does happen to deserves the consequences. JUST.PRETEND. 

If that woman and her husband, and any people like her, paused for half a second and cut the ""We're careful so anyone it happens to must have done something wrong and deserves it"" attitude, maybe they would see how they'd actually feel and act *before* experiencing the situation first hand.

The-Unmentionable_eilzm9,"I live with my boyfriend and his best friend. We signed a 2 year lease that will be up at the end of July. 

She was okay enough to live with at first but I am sick of living with her at this point. There has been growing resentment around admittedly minor things but it feels like a death by a thousand paper cuts. 

There has been a pretty major falling out between her and I who were friends at some point but I just don't like her anymore even as a friend. 

My boyfriend has definitely expressed desires to live with just me but almost never directly. He will instead just say things about how he doesn't want to deal with XYZ thing she does as a roommate, will get visibly annoyed when we have to stop cuddling on the couch and/put pants on in common areas because she is coming home, and flat out went from happy to grumpy when he found out she was coming with us on a quick errand run. 

That being said they are still best friends and he seems pretty protective over her (as shown during my recent falling out with her) so it kind of feels like conflicting feelings there. 

I know that I will not be living with this person ever again and that I will not be living away from my partner after spending 2 years under the same roof. In that way it will be a conversation for him and I privately where he can choose to live with his friend and we break up or the roommate leaves and she can come visit as a guest whenever she wants. 

I'm not trying to break up their friendship I just will not be having him choose a friend *over* me and continue dating them. They are free to stay close friends as long as her home is not that same as ours. 

Assuming he feels the same as I do about her moving out, how much time should we give her as notice that she will either need move out or find new roommates? This person has no sense of money management and lives paycheck to paycheck so I want her to have a reasonable amount of warning time to save up and GTFO.

How early should I be having this conversation with my partner and then her?"

The-Unmentionable_auqi2h,"I don't know if this is an unpopular opinion or not but I see many instances where one half of a monogamous couple comes to reddit to express that their partners are having problems with them masturbating to porn. 

Most commenters (myself included) say that masturbation is normal and healthy and that the upset partner needs to be more understanding. I can get behind all of this.

I have issue with finding out that this ""porn"" people are consuming is actually commenting, posting, and messaging with other real life people about what they'd like to do to or with them sexually. That's not watching porn. That is establishing some level of intimacy directly with another human even if it's on a superficial level. 

Commenting and posting could be totally chill if both people in the relationship are on board with it happening but trying to claim that those activities are ""just watching porn"" is a false equivalent to me. 

I'd be extremely upset to discover my partner was posting, commenting, and messaging other women on reddit but have zero issue with him scrolling through things to get his rocks off whenever he please. "

The-Unmentionable_9n4lw1,"This is a simple, rather unimportant thing all considering but I'd like to know what others would do. 

I've lived with this person for about 3 months now. Our first week living together she accidentally knocked my bf's picture down (he lives with us) and the frame broke. She offered immediately to buy a replacement frame for it. 

About three weeks ago she plowed through the upstairs hall and knocked one of my larger, nicer pictures off the wall, shattering the glass. 

She didn't mention this at all and simply cleaned it up and put the broken photo & frame in the basement.

She hasn't replaced either of these and seemingly has no intention to. I personally find it extremely rude that she wouldn't even offer to fix my frame and has yet to deal with the one she offered to pay for. 

I feel it outs me in an very uncomfortable position to ask her to replace them or at least see if thats something she is willing to do. I'm truly annoyed I have to even ask. 

I know she can afford it because she buys frivolous things on an almost daily basis while I immediately replaced something I broke in the house despite being on a very tight budget. 

I know it's just a picture and at the end of the day I can replace it myself when I have some spare funds. I am more concerned with, what I consider, the disrespectful behavior. 

Is this something worth bringing up at all or should I just let it go? What would you say if you were me? "
The-Unmentionable_9f2epp,"I want to say first that I love this man very much and see all the good he brings to our relationship of a year and half. He is extremely empathetic, giving, and kind. He is quick to give compliments, isn't one to shy away from physical affections, and is supportive of the decisions I make in my life. He's constantly trying to better his life situation to make our lives and his family's lives better. He is not perfect of course but no one is and I generally don't mind his character flaws.

I like to think I am someone who is very well in-tune with myself and my body. One of my own character flaws I have been trying hard to work on is my emotionally impulsive outbursts. I have a come a long way with this in the past few years but know I still have a long way to go. When I feel any type of emotional threat or sensitivity (which happens quite often as I am an EXTREMELY emotional and sensitive person) I tend to express that with intense, angry outbursts. I always feel guilty afterwards and usually end up crying about it due to guilt. 

To counteract this flaw of my own, I try very hard to prevent these outbursts instead of mending the situations afterwards. I generally know what my triggers are and am clear with communicating what they are to my partner. I try to suggest ways we can, together, prevent these outbursts through discussion and compromise. 

The problem is that my partner has untreated ADD and constantly brushes off my anxieties, insisting that everything will be fine without working on any issues or changing any behaviors (on both our ends). 

Most recently there was an extremely petty argument that got more out of hand than any fight we have had in the past. It is almost funny how absurd it was. The argument began because I have been feeling very lonely having to sleep in bed all night alone as he generally goes to bed at sunrise (for no reason other than that he is up playing video games and chatting online). I woke up for work AS he was going to bed and my bad mood from the built up frustrations came out full force. I am embarrassed by it and I think he is too but we have barely spoken since the incident which was nearly two days ago. This is the longest we've gone without talking because this time, for the first time, I am refusing to go him and request we sit down to discuss things. 

I know his computer addiction  is common with ADD. I know he values alone time and I am open to giving him that type of space. Before we moved in together a few months ago I asked to sit with him to discuss the bedtime issue. I told him going to bed within an hour of the other person is very important to me for a number of reasons. I tried to come up with a happy medium where he comes to bed when I do (generally between midnight and 3AM) two or three nights a week and the other nights he can stay up until whenever he'd like. He didn't really discuss or address my concerns or potential solution and assured me it wouldn't be an issue. It is. 

Previously his computer was in his bedroom so he could easily float back and forth between me and his computer. His computer is now in a totally different room and there have been times where I have gotten up at 3AM to find him not even home at all, leaving me scared and wondering about where he is and if he's alright before finding out that he just went for a bike ride or walked up the street for a snack. 

A few weeks ago we had a discussion of an unrelated issue where we discussed that I write things out for him to read when there is an issue to work through so he can retain it better. I agreed to this under the conditional that communication be a two way street as it has previously been solely me coming to him to ask that we talk through any issue. He agreed to this. 

He immediately went back to not communicating any concerns or feelings with me and though I'll take the lead (again) and write him a letter about these issues, I am quickly losing all faith that he'll ever grow emotional to even meet me half way and I don't know what to do. 

I am tired of being the only one to bring things up. It makes me feel like I am ""bothering"" him and he seems very uninterested in any of these situations. He gets upset when I have an outburst but doesn't show any interest in addressing the causes and underlying issues of what's causing them. He ignores an suggestions for what I find to be reasonable compromises. 

I don't know how to get through to him that we won't survive much longer unless these things are continuously addressed and that we are continually checking in with one another to make sure things are still good on both sides. I feel like I am the only one who cares about our relationship as he puts little effort into it's upkeep in the ways I need him too. I feel guilty since he does so many other great things for me but I'd much prefer he come through in the ways I need than surprise me in ways I don't. 

I don't want to feel self loathing because my triggers are continually pushed upon. I am positive he loves me deeply and I know he wants to address these things but seems unable to. Despite this, he is against getting treatment for his ADD. 

Is there any hope for us? Am I completely in the wrong for feeling this way? Any suggestions would be of great help. 

TL;DR: 
I can't get my ADD partner to communicate through issues with me and he is uncompromising in his ways, despite them creating a lot of conflict and petty drama between us. What can I do?"
The-Unmentionable_8vli7d,"Hello lovely people. 

I am searching for info on people's experiences of life after getting their Paragard removed. More specifically I am looking for experiences from those who have NOT tried getting pregnant after removal and have NOT used any other type of birth control (condoms, pulling out, and FAM aside) after removal.

I had my Paragard removed on May 29th because I did not like the unlisted side effects it was giving me. Prior to Paragard I had a highly consistent and predictable 28 days cycle. Every month it was very light bleeding, zero cramping, and one day of MILD PMS. I want my body to get back to that life!

I spotted for 10 days after removal (my actual period was within this timeframe but it was extremely light) and have just gotten my second period post removal. I am concerned because my PMS this month was still fairly intense and lasted about 5 days and my cramping last night kept me up from sleep. While this is an improvement from the PMS and cramping I experienced with the IUD in, I am wondering how long I can expect it to be until I am 100% back to my ""normal"" self. 

Anyone here take a similar path as me? Everything I look up inline involves people who got it removed so they could try and get pregnant or they immediately went on a different BC so they bodies are following a different path than the ""detox"" I am looking for!

SadDamegami_1bh3plq,"So I recently started the tretinoin gel at 0.025 concentration. I started using face oils at night as I was recommended this a lot.

Moisturizer is either Peter Thomas Roth water drench or kiehls ultra facial. 

Sunscreen is laroche posay anti Helios 60spf chemical sunscreen 

During the day I noticed I’ve been having some flaking around the edges of my mouth and my upper lip. 

Thoughts on putting some squalane oil on after moisturizer and before my sunscreen?(there are so many mixed opinions on this when I researched it!)  
"
SadDamegami_1bgaru3,"Hi I just moved from retinol to a tretinoin Gel 0.025 concentration. 

Last week I tried to use it waiting 20 minutes after I used my night moisturizer that has squalane. I was unable to get it spread out with a pea sized amount and it made my moisturizer immediately pill (lol). 

My friend said that I should be using moisturizer, then squalane oil, then using the tret gel either immediately after the oil.

Alternatively, She said that it would also help if I splash my face with water after the oil sinks in and then applying the Tret gel while my face is still wet.

I’m honestly really so confused. How am I supposed to spread the gel out? Should I use squalane oil then tret immediately after or just wait the 20 minutes between moisturizer. The idea of splashing water seems a little silly but I am tempted to try it.

Can I please have some help with building this new phase of my routine or any tips/help with using the gel? (Mainly how to get full face coverage!)

MathematicianOk1104_l1mc8f,"What do you guys think abt this? After watching the show more and more times I get this strong impression that the first Gen of skins was actually written to be a film, it would make sense with the massive dip in quality after the first two seasons! I feel like they didn’t know what else to write about following that. It just seems like it was meant to be a movie but was rewritten for TV or something. Like they brought it to a producer and they said “mmm too risky for a movie but good for a tv show bc if people hate it we can just cancel❤️”"

to anyone on it- has this happened to you? i’m feeling very hopeless because i’ve tried many medications and nothing seems to be helping. does food really effect it? or coffee? i tried a few days without drinking coffee, or having 1 cup before i take it. i don’t notice any difference. also with food- i’ve only taken it in the morning on an empty stomach- and eaten a hour or so later. i am vegetarian and don’t love eggs so protein is hard for me, which i heard helps a lot to have.

hi everyone. i recently used the calculator here and found out i am around a 36G cup (USA). i have been wearing a 38DD and have always had spillage and no support but i recently bought a bra from mercari in 36G and it’s been life changing  

i have two questions

- what is the UK size equivalent to 36G, every site i feel like tells me different things, and i want to try a UK brand cause I hear they are better

- where can i buy affordable bras! preferably under $30. i am in college and struggling with money so i can’t splurge right now.

Bigbittytitty_1dcfcfk,"I took a break from dating for about 2 years to work on myself. Back story I was the girl who would get into very toxic/abusive relationships for ignoring red flags. So after therapy & some 12 step meetings I decided to give it another go BUT to be more aware this time. A guy and I had a date planned and when I checked in he was SILENT for 3 days then on the day of the plans said he was no longer free & tried to continue to conversation like nothing happened. 

My friends think this is a red flag and how he made no effort to remake plans or apologize for lack of communication. I removed myself from the situation entirely because poor communication is a turn off for me. Also to be frank, I have no space for the mind games/jumping through hoops tryna to figure out if someone’s into me or not. 

So I just wanted to ask the peanut gallery is this a red flag for you or is it too premature to tell? "
Bigbittytitty_1bxw2af,"I 25 F have seen my father probably 4 times in my entire life. I forgot what he looked like and asked my half sister for a picture. When I got it I regretted that I did that. Some people in my family would tell me I look so much like him but I would brush it off.

I always had hope I would grow into looking more like my mother who is absolutely gorgeous. But, knowing I look like a man I don’t even know nor like makes me feel so disgusting. I never really thought I was a beautiful person but this makes it worse. My half sister even said him and I look like twins.

There’s so much I don’t know about him but from all the stories I hear that he was awful and caused so much people pain. But now seeing how he looks makes me wonder if my mom seeing my face all the time triggered her. There were times growing up she was extremely physically abusive and I never really knew why. She would beat me so bad I thought I was the worst child in the world.  Seeing his face….. I think that’s my answer. 

My father groomed women who were not within his age bracket, stole from many people, abandoned all this kids, cheated on his wife, abused my half siblings, and so much more that I don’t even know. 

I don’t want to be a reminder of this man. I’m seriously thinking about cosmetic surgery to the moment I can afford it."

I’ve lost 30/35 pounds since then. But I’m lingering between 235-240 for the past couple of weeks and I’m getting frustrated. 

I’m 5’5 25F! 

Currently I’ve made a switch in my diet a month ago by cutting out meat and dairy because I was getting sulfur burps. Eating twice a day predominantly fruits and vegetables. I’m unsure if I’m not getting enough protein or maybe I need to switch up my exercise routine. Any help or advice would be very appreciated!!!! "

Bigbittytitty_18wtph4,"I 23 F have a controlling “uncle” in my life who said he’ll pay for half of my student loans if I basically act a certain way. He’s family friend of my moms who’s known me since I was born and basically see’s me as a daughter. Recently he said he’ll pay for my student loans which I was really happy about because I’ve been struggling. It was under one condition take out my eyebrow piercing. I didn’t really care because I could always get it redone. I saw him recently and he took me to a brunch party. I didn’t do anything I wouldn’t do infornt of my own mom. But, he twisted the night to make it seem I was acting provocative, inappropriate, and partaking in drugs. Which did none of those things! Anyways he called me immoral, that I don’t meet his standards, and if I want my student loans paid I need to get in line with his standards. 

I owe over $50k in student loans but at this point I’m not sure I want to be controlled over money or alter myself to someone unrealistic expectations of me. On the other hand my grandma thinks I should just swallow my pride a bit for the money to get closer out of debt. Would really love advice on this. Thanks in advance!"

Bigbittytitty_13x4aek,"This is a very short version but here it goes: I was seeing this person for a little bit of time and then he realized that he’s emotionally unavailable and I deserve more. (He’s dealing with religious trauma) so we agreed to be friends. It was going pretty well because I enjoying hanging out with him and hearing his perspective on the world. 

Then, lines and boundaries were crossed he kissed me and it then escalated. I guess in my mind I thought this meant that he liked me but it just wasn’t the right time or whatever. It just felt nice hanging out, talking for hours, and the physical aspects of it. Then one night we had a few drinks almost had sex for the first time and there was just this explosion of emotion from me. I can’t remember the conversation because of how many drinks I kept having after he was telling me things I didn’t want to hear. It ended up with me crying and kicking him out of my apartment. 

He’s been apologizing and I’m giving myself space because usually I forgive and continue talking to the person because of my fear of abandonment. But after having a little bit of space, he asked for my mailing address to send me an apology letter and I don’t know how I feel about it. A large parts of me wants to just talk to him but I’m worried I’ll get sucked back into my codependent tendencies. He’s told me forming this thoughts into words is hard so I can see how he may want to send a letter. But now I’m just anxious about what it’s going to say, when it’s going to get here, is this his way of cutting ties completely. My head is just facing.  I went to a coda meeting yesterday and felt great today I just feel helpless. I guess I miss him and I want to talk to him…

My roommate is a trans woman and she just recently have been living in her truth. During this time she’s also started dating. Lately I’ve been noticing that the men she’s been dating always tell her they’ve never been with a trans woman before and I’ve heard them say alarming things. I’ve spoken to her about this and have vocalized my concern with some of these men. I have even asked her to share her location with me and lmk when she’s going on a date. Tonight one of the men made me especially concerned. She was on the phone with him and the guy asked a question regarding her genitalia stating “she should keep it because it makes her hotter” and how “he’s never been with a trans before”. She seemed taken a back but continued talking to this guy. 
This isn’t my life but I’m worried about these guys she’s talking to and their intentions because they don’t seem genuine……. I know some men like to fetishize trans women and I don’t want her to be used and/or heartbroken.

I also understand if it’s not my place to say anything I just want to make sure she’s okay……"

Bigbittytitty_x4xshp,"I work in a rehab sober living home and I LOVE it!!! But, I’m only getting paid $20. I live in LA so obviously the cost of living is incredibly high. This job has a lot of responsibilities. Constantly having to monitor and clean up after a number of people. That’s not the issue though. I pretty much only get three days (which isn’t enough) and two of my days are weekends. My coworkers suck and refuse to switch or cover me whenever something comes up. And when I asked for more hours they wanted to give me a PM shift on Friday. So basically I won’t have any weekend time what do over. 

I want to ask for a raise but I haven’t been working there that long. And some of my coworkers and I feel as though the pay and the work we do isn’t matching up.

How should I approach this situation? Do I have a meeting or just look for a new job?"
Bigbittytitty_x1r7sn,"My friend and I have been friends for about 4 years now. We have a very strong bond and connection. This may sound odd but the first time I met him I just had this deep feeling for him. About two years ago we even stated how compatible we are and how we could see something between us. We even drunkenly made a marriage pact together. But, since then times have changed. He now has a “fiancé” and says that he very much loves her. But I personally don’t support the relationship due to this mistreatment and verbal/physical abuse she’s done to him. He’s called me multiple times in hysterics over this. 

The reason I’m bringing this up is recently he called me just venting on the verge of tears about this relationship and the external stressors from his life. I now feel as if it’s my duty as a friend to talk to him about this. Disclaimer I’m not trying to tell him I’m in love with him as I feel as though that is disrespectful to the relationship. But, what kind of friend would I be not to say something about this. 

I’m unsure how to approach the situation because I truly don’t want to lose his friendship. I just cannot sit back while I watch this lovely person deteriorate slowly from this."
Bigbittytitty_wn5qix,"So, I got a group of friends and we planned a trip to the Bahamas. We planned this in May and everything is paid for. Keep in mind we leave in less than two weeks. My friend just found out the booked a short film (They’re an actor) and I’m soooo happy for them BUT it’s shooting during the trip. When they informed me I told them to do what feels best because I know acting is important to them. So they chose the job. But, now they’re expecting a refund. I lowered the number for Airbnb there was no refund offered. So my friends and I would have to split what they paid in order to “refund” them. And I discussed with the other girls and they don’t believe it’s fair to them to pay almost $200 each in order to refund them…. 

I told them I could try to put forward half of that money but my friends don’t think that’s fair to me either. I’m hearing mix things from people. On one hand I don’t believe it’s fair for us to pay extra especially on such short notice. And another hand I know that’s a lot of money to lose."
Bigbittytitty_wmy3bt,I planned a trip months again with a group of friends to the Bahamas. The trip is in two weeks.

I completely understand that the role is important to them but the trip was planned with 5 people in mind not 4. We already paid for an Airbnb etc.Due to them not going anymore all of us who are going would have to pay them back $200. Which I don’t find fair !! That’s $200 we didn’t plan for especially less than 2 weeks before the trip. I’m unsure about how to address this….. we’re all okay getting money together to refund half of their payment but I don’t think we can do full. I just want advice or opinions of the situation at hand….
Bigbittytitty_w7w4sg,"I’m a 23 year old woman and the first time I saw porn was when I was 6 years old. I wasn’t sure what it was but it looked fun and I tried to recreate what I saw with a male childhood friend. My grandma caught me I obviously got in trouble and I suppressed that memory for a long time. When I was 11 I saw porn again and it made me feel a certain way. This time it was lesbian porn and I felt so gross that I prayed for God to forgive me. Fast forward to when I was 14 and so on I began watching porn every now and then. I felt weird touching myself but as I got older it felt fine. It made me feel good and it helped me fall asleep. I’m looking at my life now and I masturbate almost every night sometimes multiple times a day. I can never be satisfied or cum during sex with other either when toys are involved and I believe it’s because of my porn habits. I tried to stop but I didn’t even last two weeks. The porn I’ve been watching went from vanilla to some pretty intense stuff. 


I’m unsure what steps to take in order to get over this addiction. I don’t talk about it with anyone and I know I should probably get a therapist but I can’t afford it at the moment. Any advice would really help…

Bigbittytitty_vynjz4,"I’ve (23F) been friends with this girl (24F) for about 6 years. We were friends in Highschool. She now lives in the same state as me and we hang out every now and then. A month ago I talked to her about constantly leaving me on read or not responding to my messages when I ask her to hang out. She told me she’d work on that. Anyways a mutual friend of ours who was also apart of our friend group in high school was visiting. I told her a month in advance that we should plan something together. I tried texting her and inviting her out with us and she said she’d let me know. A week goes by and she doesn’t reach out. Our friend left without seeing her (it’s been 3 years for them). Next thing I know the girl texts me saying she’s sorry she didn’t hang with us and she “lowkey” had COVID. At this point I want to cut her off because it takes 30 secs to send a message saying you’re not coming. 

Is this one of those cases where I should try to talk to her again or just let it go? 

I know people grow apart and I’m not sadden but losing the friendship if I’m being honest. Her making no effort to hang out with our mutual friend really bugged me."

Anyways two days before the date he stopped responding out of no where. Never hit me up or anything. The day of the date came and I didn’t get a texted so I said alright he’s ghosting me. About a month goes by and he just texted me saying he’s sorry for ghosting but, he’s settled with moving and wants to hang out. LOL tbh the ghosting put a bad taste in my mouth…. I understand he’s new in town but it doesn’t take more than 30 secs to send a text."
Bigbittytitty_vk1wol,So since I was little my father was never in my life and from then I find myself always equating my self worth with a mans opinion about me. Recently I decided not to date while I work on this. I went out last night to have some fun and met this man who seems really cool and he asked for my info to hang out. He turned out not being so cool because he blocked me for no reason. And this bothered me a lot and now I’m worried if anyone would like me. Which is crazy because I don’t even really know this person yet they have me questioning myself.

Our friendship was basically non existent until I spoke to them about how it made me feel. We ended up talking a bit more and it was great. Fast forward we’re all on okay terms and we move back to LA when places started opening up again. Things were really different once again. For the whole year we were in LA I saw them 4 times. Communication was sooooo poor only this time when I was doing something that seemed “cool” I’d get a text message from them. Whether I’m working with celebrities or in a commercial there she appears. I love them… when we hang out I always have a great time but, the fact she only checks in when I’m “doing something” is alarming because it never use to be like that. I’m not sure if I should talk to them again or just save my breath?"
Bigbittytitty_uuiup0,"I’ve known I was bisexual from a young age but, I’ve always suppressed it due to some of my homophobic family… Now that I’m older I’ve realized it’s my life and I don’t want to suppress this part of my life. Since I’ve dated I’ve only seen cisgender men and a non-binary person recently. I really want to start dating women but, I don’t want anyone to feel like they’re an “experiment” for me. I just get a bit nervous when trying to approach them. I’m also in LA so if anyone knows great places for singles to meet that’d be great. I would love advice on how to get myself out there."
Bigbittytitty_ujscad,"Ive know my roommate for years and I love them I do. But, I don’t want to work with them AND live with them. I don’t like their current job right now and I completely understand that but, I don’t want them expecting me to drive them to work (they rarely offer to give me gas money) and I enjoy being away from them. How can I bring this up without seeming like an asshole?"
Bigbittytitty_sn4yed,"Hey y’all,

(I hope I don’t offend anyone with my ignorance!!)
I’ve been on 7 dates with this guy. We’ve been seeing each other for about a month now (not exclusive). He told me that he’s been exploring his sexuality and dating. But, the last date we had he told me he use to believe he was asexual but now identifies with Demi sexuality. 

I’ve tried googling about it but, I wanted to hear from others about ways I could make him comfortable. How long did you take you to feel comfortable with someone you were going on dates with? How long to be exclusive? What makes you more comfortable sexually with someone? What’s something you wish people who weren’t demisexual would understand? 

I at times try to open up conversations and boundaries with him but, he gets a bit anxious when I ask questions. And I don’t want him to feel extremely uncomfortable."
Bigbittytitty_sc3l7v,"I’ve (23F) been seeing this guy (30M) since the beginning of this month. He makes me laugh, he’s extremely sweet, and I think we have amazing chemistry. The first date was amazing and we’ve seen each other 1 day every week. And I’ve slept over his place twice now. But, I’m so scared to bring up my feelings I’m not going to lie. 

Two weeks ago I asked what he wanted out of being on dating apps and he stated how he hasn’t had much dating experience so he’s not really sure but he finds himself thinking about me when I’m not around and how he’s fond of me and loves spending time with me.

I’m not sure how long people wait to have the exclusive talk or when people bring up their feelings.
Or how to even gage to see if feelings are reciprocated."
Bigbittytitty_rzlcx7,What reasons would you have for waiting for sex with someone you’re dating? (Not exclusive yet)
Bigbittytitty_rxahgd,"Okay so I realized I want to date around and actually find someone that I’d eventually hope to date. But, I want to continue to fuck my FWB while I do this. Is that wrong? Especially if I don’t tell the guys I go on dates with? Also do I need to tell people I’m casually dating that I am also dating other people? Im still fairly new to dating and I don’t wanna do anything shady…"
Bigbittytitty_roctfd,"So I was having this discussion with a friend about body count and I wanted other peoples opinions. Does it matter how many people your partner has slept with?? If it does matter to you what would you consider a high number?? 

Personally I don’t think it’s my business and I would rather not know someone’s body count. And if they were to tell me I don’t think it’d matter that much."
Bigbittytitty_ro5iyx,"Of course I don’t mean all men!!!! My ex really fucked me up. He was manipulative, sexual and emotionally abusive. After I finally left I told myself I wouldn’t get in a relationship for awhile. The people I’ve met are absolutely disgusting to me. They’re not upfront about what they want, they play games/ pretend they’re interested in me then they ghost me or make up excuses. At this point it’s fucking hilarious. I will sit there and say please let me know if you’re not interested. Yet they still ghost me. Or they would clearly want sex and I’ll say lemme know if this is just a hook up. I guess I’m just frustrated that no one can be upfront about their feelings and intentions. I’m a fucking human being. And I don’t deserve to be treated like I don’t have any feelings. That is all."
Bigbittytitty_r689m9,"At this point I feel like something is wrong with me. I’ve never came from sex (oral or vaginal penetration ). I know how to make myself cum when I masturbate but, having sex with others nothing. I’m not sure if it got worse since I’ve been on birth control but, I dry out quicker than I use to. And condoms especially dry me out !! 

Last night I had sex with a guy and I told him that I need a lot of foreplay because I’ve never came during sex. He tried I shit you not for an hour and a half trying to get me off. From head, fingering, and I even tried a finger in the butt and NOTHING !!! It took so long I just got so frustrated with it and told him to just get himself off.

Please I need advice preferably from other women/ femme identifying ppl who have experienced this. The last time I asked a lot of men just kept saying “teach him” or “use a toy” but it’s not that simple for me. I’ve tried toys while having sex and nothing. 

Should I try a sex pill or are those bad for you?"
Bigbittytitty_qz13yy,"I have a metal plate and a bunch of screws in my left foot. It causes me to not be able to stand on my feet long periods of time or when it gets cold out I get in serious amount of pain which causes swelling and at times I limp.

I’ve told my job this before hoping that they could make accommodations for me (we have sitting positions) but often I’m ignored by supervisors and still sent to stand for my whole shift or I’m met with eye rolls….

I’m not sure what to do about this situation. And I’m not sure if it’s my own personal problem or if it’s an actual disability/ handicap? (Quitting is hard as it pays above minimum and I’m looking for a job that pays the same)"
Bigbittytitty_qmer62,After being in a relationship for awhile I decided to dabble in hooking up as I don’t want to get in a relationship for awhile. I do have trouble being a bit confident when it comes to sex when it comes to my body and being nude. Does anyone have tips on how to deal with this? I usually just make sure the lights are all off….
Bigbittytitty_qa6yvn,"Whenever I have sex it’s either fun or just really bad. The closest I got was with my ex boyfriend. All my friends talk about how they finish and cum but, that’s never happened for me. Can someone please give me tips? I’ve used toys and it helps me but I never finish. I’m not too sure if I’m too tense or what…"
Bigbittytitty_pqvb13,"I’ve been hanging out with this guy who’s funny, adorable, and just a catch. But the sex was the worst I’ve had in my entire life I lasted for less than 5 mins. Would it be wrong of me to end things or should I give it another shot?

If it were you what would u do?"
somedudemack99_1den53q,I’m not a league bowler anything I just like to do it for fun and got the summer pass at my local bowling alley. My roommate has bowled most of her life and she’s given me pointers but ffs I cannot for the love of me kick my trail leg behind me. I think it comes from my years of playing Oline in football and it’s engrained in my head to not pick my feet up in an athletic stance because if you have a foot off the ground you’re basically easier to push over. I may be wrong but there has to be a super dumbed down way to explain it.
somedudemack99_1de80gj,I feel like absolute shit because I woke up hitting my wife and dogs from night terrors. I hate not knowing what triggered them. 
somedudemack99_1dbk1bo,I would love a touring bike to crush miles on but it simply wasn’t in my budget so I got a Dyna. Tell me why everything that’s not a bagger is a girls bike to these idiots and most of them bought a bagger to ride to the local bar and back. 
somedudemack99_1dbj6c4,Looking at getting one for my wife possibly
somedudemack99_1dauojm,Looking at either a Mustang Wide Touring seat or Saddleman Explorer with drivers Backrest. My uncle swears by Mustang for crushing miles and I even had the same seat on my Softail Custom and it was quite comfy. Everyone else seems to be going with Saddleman and overall it looks better with the Lattice Stitching and has the gel core but I’ve never sat on one. The Mustang is $645 and the Saddleman is $658 for the most basic options so not much difference in price.

I’m thinking a built 1200 motor, mid controls with forward pegs to stretch out, Tbars with or without pullback risers, 2 into 1 exhaust, possibly something similar to a bung king crash bar, and try to make it light as possible. My idea is trying to collide choppers with the performance Dynas, FXRs, and Baggers. I’ll probably catch some flak for the idea but if you’ve seen something like this somewhere send pictures or links.

somedudemack99_199zz49,"I detail a lot of Harley Davidson motorcycles and one of my customers showed me something called Engine Brightener for the wrinkled black engines, primaries, and what not and it shined it well. I’ve seen Hog Spit and S1000 as well but they’re still almost the same price."
somedudemack99_191vkc7,I detail motorcycles as a side gig and currently do everything by hand which is ideal for the small areas of a motorcycle but is way more time consuming when doing baggers and trikes (even though I haven’t done one of those yet). I also want to be able to get deeper scratches and swirls out of paint something I feel I can’t do without a DA polisher but if you have any suggestions on how to do so by hand that’d be greatly appreciated. I’ve been looking at most brands corded and battery powered and have gotten a suggestion from body shop owner on the Milwaukee fuel 15mm DA polisher

somedudemack99_17tlehi,"I grew up with my dad going to Baptist church as that’s the majority of what’s in the South and as I got older I started going to non denominational churches. A lot of my deceased relatives were Catholic and my Grandmother was the one who changed things up.

I also don’t know the dress code and don’t want to look out of place I’m a blue collar worker and a biker and most of my clothes are jeans, tshirts, and what not. I don’t want to go underdressed but my Sundays best will most likely be jeans and maybe a nicer button up shirt."
somedudemack99_17brofz,I’ve been smoking on a pack and they’re decent not quite as strong menthol as Camel Crush menthol but then again they’re cheaper. Camel Crush menthols are 8 almost 9 dollars after tax in my state but the Lucky Strike Activates were 4 and some change because there was a $1 off coupon on the pack. I also can’t find them on the lucky strike website so does that mean they were limited quantity or what.

It’s like my meds have taken the ability for me to care how it would make  them feel away.

somedudemack99_n2ulfj,"So when I was younger I used to be quite the homophobic, transphobic, and racist individual and said some things that reflected that back then that I knew had to have driven people away. I was raised by my dad and grandmother in South Mississippi who I learned it from plus the conservative Christian ideology. Both of them would regularly use slurs around me yet at the same time tell me don’t say it. I can remember my dad telling me that bisexuals were worse than gays because they would f*ck guys and then spread the diseases to the women and that if he ever found out I was gay or bisexual he would kill me (jokes on him I’m pansexual and he ain’t gonna do nothing.). Anyways I still hate myself for being that way and driving people away but I didn’t know any better and was a product of my environment. I just wish I could I could tell everyone I’m sorry and that I’m nothing like I used to be."

My problem is that I feel like no one else in the community would approach because of the way I look and that being a big guy who has facial hair and I’m usually in work clothes and when I’m not it’s usually shorts and a t-shirt.  It’s like I don’t look queer enough for anyone to approach but I guess being the area of the country I am in it would make sense because they may think I’m a right wing conservative overly religious types. Is there some way to kind of say “hey I’m one of you” without l literally saying it?"

This is just a me in my own mind kind of question. Women have wider hips than men do because they have to carry babies. Now that being said could that mean that women may actually be better at carrying a backpack because a majority of the weight rides on the hips? Men are overall stronger in the upper body and are generally larger therefore they carry more weight but maybe not as well because of narrower hips. Don’t laugh please I’m just thinking this out"

I deliver construction job sites obviously so I have to deal with mud, standing water, and some uneven terrain. I also find myself often climbing onto the flatbeds while loading and unloading. Even though job sites require steel toes rules don’t apply to delivery drivers but my employer doesn’t require steel toes. I like stitched soles for the possibility of resoling but not required.

I don’t mind snakes on trail  or when they’re over there and I’m over here because I know to expect them, avoid them, and leave them be because they don’t want to mess with me as much as I don’t want to mess with them.
