lichprince_1co3v7l,"I posted here a few days re: an issue I’m having with an in network provider and got some helpful info, but both BCBS and my provider are telling me contradictory things. TL;DR: I am in a mental health program that requires preauthorization, my provider didn’t obtain it, and now both my insurance and my provider are telling me I’m on the hook for $1.9k *per day* of the program. This is a thrice weekly program that runs for twelve weeks. I can’t afford $68.4k of treatment, but nobody is budging on me owing for these denied claims. My provider says that they tried to obtain a preauth, but my insurance told them that it wasn’t necessary, so it’s my responsibility. My insurance is saying it’s necessary, but my provider failed to get it, so it’s my responsibility. Then, when I ask how to obtain a retroactive preauthorization, I’m put on a lengthy hold, which eventually kicks me back to the main automated menu. Yesterday, a rep at BCBS said they tried to call my provider but were sent to voicemail; when I called <90 seconds later, I got through without trouble. None of the reps at BCBS that I’ve been able to speak to are willing to do a three way call; they say I must speak to their preauthorization department and transfer me, but all I get is the aforementioned hold music. I’m really not sure what to do from here."
lichprince_1clog3n,"I am currently participating in an IOP with an in network provider. I started a few weeks ago and was provided with a financial breakdown upon starting the program, but unbeknownst to me, my provider did not obtain the required preauthorization for my care. I now have a claim saying I owe $1.9k when my copay for that service should be only $40, per my SBC and the financial breakdown I received. Said EOB is not fully generated yet, but I have spoken with a BCBS representative, who told me the reason for the denial. I am calling my program’s financial department later today, but I’m wondering what I should expect and whether I need to start figuring out a way to pay this $1.9k. I am in New York state and met my $800 deductible prior to starting this program but have not yet met my $3.9k OOPM."
lichprince_1cg86kx,"Hey, y’all. Going through some rough times and looking to downsize my collection some to help. I don’t have anything super rare or collectible except [an unsealed copy of LPSS](https://imgur.com/a/CFCaFBf), which I’m looking to sell for $300 including shipping to anywhere in the United States. PayPal G&S only."

lichprince_1cbgsfp,"Hi, y’all! Long term DM with 8 years of experience in 5e looking to add another game to my rotation. I’m 25, trans masc, and have two cats, one of which is named after an obscure British horror author who died of cyanide poisoning. I love vampires, Taylor Swift, and I’ve logged 240 hours in BG3. Unexpectedly, I’ve only romanced the pale elf once. I live in New York, and ideally, all of my players will be in EST.

I’ve been running a 1-20 campaign for the last three and a half years, but I’ve been feeling a little D&D starved lately, so I’m looking for some experienced players to join me (and a friend) in running a prewritten module. Specifically, I’m looking at Descent into Avernus, Rime of the Frostmaiden, or Out of the Abyss, but I’m flexible. Whatever we end up playing will most likely end up heavily doctored anyway. I am free most nights, including weekdays, but my Sundays are spoken for.

I’m looking for no more than four players who are comfortable with a heavy emphasis on roleplay, even if that means occasional suboptimal choices, but still enjoy combat and the mechanics of the game. My games definitely skew a bit more on the serious side, but we still have fun! I also don’t really shy away from mature themes, which is why I would prefer my players to be 21+ (sorry). For example, I think that inequity is a really interesting theme to explore, but I also don’t think that tieflings or orcs should be denied entry to villages solely on the basis of being a tiefling or orc. IMO, that’s a pretty lazy way of grappling with inequity. That said, nothing sexually graphic will ever happen at my table. I also like to think that, as a DM, I foster collaboration, not competition.

I hate R20 with a passion and really, really like the new DDB Maps, so we would be using a combination of that and Discord to run our games, which I would prefer to be weekly. I am open to pretty much any combination of any official races, classes, and backgrounds, but I am not the biggest fan of homebrew unless there is an obvious gap in the existing content.

If it seems like we might be a good fit, please fill out the Google form below, and I will be in touch!

lichprince_1caqvxb,"Looking for a nice place to celebrate my birthday at this June. We usually celebrate at Toutant, and I’d be happy to stick with them because the food is amazing, but I’m getting the impression that my family would prefer to mix it up. I’ve looked at Patina 250, Billy Club, and Chez Ami, but I’m torn. Any suggestions? Most previous threads I’ve looked at recommend Toutant."
lichprince_1caokmu,"Plans abruptly changed, and now I can’t make it to the Toronto show tomorrow night. I have two tickets available (section 106, row C). I paid $72 CAD each through Ticketmaster, so I’d ideally like to recoup that, but I’ll take basically anything at this point."
lichprince_1ba6eac,"Let’s cut to the chase: I’m currently running Tomb of Annihilation, and over the course of my party’s adventure, they’ve managed to get their hands on an efreeti bottle. They uncorked the bottle during combat, and by some stroke of luck, they got three wishes out of it. They used their first to teleport away from the combat in question (to a few hexes away from Omu, for those of y’all familiar with the adventure). I don’t know what they intend to use their second for, but a player of mine has given me a heads up that they plan on using their third to go three months back in time. As far as I’m aware, the specific-ish phrasing of their wish is “I wish for \[their and their companions’ names\] to be in this exact spot three months in the past with all of our memories and gear intact.” Or something along those lines.

I get it. Two characters’ spouses have fallen victim to the death curse, and a third’s is on his way out, and reversing time in this manner (theoretically) brings them back to life. It circumvents the curse without using resurrection magic. I’m inclined to give it to them, even, and allow them to save their spouses in this way, even though it’s not exactly within the parameters of the spell. I think it makes a good story. Rule of cool and all. I’m just also completely wracking my brain trying to figure out some kind of drawback, because while I’m willing to reward their strategic thinking, I know the efreeti will be… less tolerant.

Please help!"
lichprince_1aoensi,"Maybe ten-ish years ago, I stumbled across a compilation album of covers of songs featured in the Shrek movies. I think the album cover may have been a pale yellow. All of the featured musicians were niche, relatively obscure folk punk artists, so I’ve been having zero luck digging the album up. It was on Bandcamp. I’m specifically trying to track this version of Accidentally in Love down to show my sister, but no searches are yielding any fruit."
lichprince_1afokhg,"I have a laundry list of prescriptions, including lisdexamfetamine. As many of you probably already know, there is a stimulant shortage right now. This includes lisdexamfetamine. I can and do tolerate this generic, but I can’t actually get it because it’s not in stock at any in-network pharmacies in my area. As such, I have been prescribed brand name Vyvanse. Up until now, this has run me $81 for a thirty day supply. As you also probably already know, the generic for this medication only became available last summer, which means that Takeda’s savings program was discontinued 1/1/2024. This means my cost for brand name Vyvanse has shot up to $146 for a thirty day supply.  I cannot afford $1,752 per year for this medication on top of my other necessary medical care, nor do I know anybody who could, but Caremark has told me that I basically have no choice but to figure it out or change medications. 

I have tried Provigil, Nuvigil, and Adderall XR for my condition with no success. I asked about a tier exception, which they said I was not eligible for because brand name Vyvanse was removed from my plan’s formulary 1/1/2024. I asked about a formulary exception, which they said was also not an option. I have been tearing my hair out for 24 hours trying to figure out a path forward, but I can’t seem to find one, which brings me to my next question.

I have a prescription OOPM of $2.9k. I will not meet this, even paying $146 every thirty days for brand name Vyvanse, but I have confirmed that brand name Vyvanse does count toward it. I was, however, just prescribed Lumryz, which is a specialty prescription obtained from a specialty pharmacy that, according to my plan’s cost calculator, will run me $3,960 for a thirty day supply. Avadel, who manufactures Lumryz, has a savings program that will likely bring my actual cost down to $0. My understanding is that Caremark doesn’t know or care how much I actually pay for my prescriptions, just what the copay they generate is. Is saving the $1,752 as simple as “paying” for one month of Lumryz, thereby meeting my OOPM? Or is there something I’m missing?"
lichprince_19dyjhe,"My mom is looking to purchase a new laptop in the coming weeks, primarily for grad school but also some limited personal browsing. We are in New York state looking for something no more than $1k, including taxes and shipping. We do have Amazon Prime, if there happens to be a good deal on Amazon, but we’re also avid Target shoppers. She would prefer something new, not refurbished, and she uses a Lenovo for work, so she is a little stuck on that brand specifically, but I think she can probably be swayed. She does not want a MacBook or any kind of convertible tablet, she is not in love with the idea of a touchscreen, and she is not exactly technologically savvy, so something particularly user-friendly would be amazing. A numeric keypad would also be a great plus. No programming, no video/photo editing, no gaming... the most powerful thing she’ll be running is Zoom.

I personally have a MacBook Pro and have overwhelmed myself looking at reviews, so I would appreciate the help greatly."

Anything I'd want to trade it for would be an extremely unfair/uneven trade, so at the moment, I'm just looking to sell. What do y'all think would be a fair price?

Mom and I both have insurance through our employers; sister is a dependent on mom’s, which is a PPO through United Healthcare with a $800 deductible and $3.9k OOPM. Upon arriving here, sister needed acute mental health treatment, which was unfortunately only available at an OON hospital. We spent weeks looking for alternative options, but there were none. After some fighting with UHC, we eventually got her into the program; the program then recommended that she enroll in Medicaid, as it will open up treatment options for her in the area. My understanding is that she was taken to the hospital’s financial services department today, qualified, and enrolled. My question now is... which is going to be primary for her? Medicaid or mom’s UHC? I’m more than a little worried mom’s will be primary and that we will keep having to jump through hoops to get her the treatment that she needs, despite this program’s best efforts to give her her best shot at getting better."

Should I pay off some of my $18k in credit card debt or throw it in savings so I have something resembling an emergency fund? I have received conflicting advice from the internet, family members, and even from this subreddit. I have a high-yield savings account with Discover but no savings beyond than what’s in my 401k, as all of my spare money goes to paying down my debt.

lichprince_108nv4q,"I asked about this here not too long ago, but some information about my plans has changed since then, and I was wondering if I could get a fresh set of eyes on my situation. When I asked previously, I was under the impression that my doctor was OON for my secondary plan, and I was told that, as a result, my primary would handle my treatment in full.

I got outpatient surgery on January 4 with a surgeon and at a hospital that, turns out, are IN for both plans. It was a preauthorized elective surgery. My plan (my primary, through my employer) is a PPO with a deductible of $1500, an OOPM of $4500, and 20% coinsurance for this particular procedure. My mom’s plan (my secondary, through her employer) is also a PPO with a deductible of $800, an OOPM of $3900, and 10% coinsurance for this procedure. 

Given that the doctor is IN for both plans, and given these numbers, would my mom’s plan cover any of the cost of the surgery? Or am I still looking at $1500 + 20%?"
lichprince_ygo2mn,"I am 24 and have insurance through both my employer and my mother. I am getting an outpatient surgery on January 4, 2023 and am trying to estimate what I may be responsible for and how my two insurances may interact. My surgeon is in-network for my primary insurance but out-of-network for my secondary.

Primary: Aetna PPO, in-network deductible of $1,500, in-network OOP max of $4,500. I am responsible for 20% after my deductible is met.

Secondary: UHC PPO, out-of-network deductible of $1,500, out-of-network OOP max of $7,600. I am responsible for 30% after my deductible is met. 

I understand all of these numbers individually but not quite how they work together. Please help!"
lichprince_xmtz7r,"I am in New York state. Apologies if I chose the incorrect flair, I am new to this sub.

I have a PPO through my employer with a $1.5k deductible and $4.5k in-network OOP max. As of September, I have spent $900 toward my deductible and $2.1k toward my OOP max. I max out my health care FSA every year, and my employer provides an additional $200 in an ~~HSA~~ HRA. I currently have $275 of this money remaining for 2022, inclusive of the employer-provided ~~HSA~~ HRA. I am in the process of scheduling a voluntary hysterectomy and am torn on whether to schedule it for December 2022 or January 2023. I have already spoken with my insurance, and I am responsible for 20% of this procedure after my deductible is met. They did not provide me with any other cost information, just my benefits.

I am truly torn on whether to:

1. schedule the procedure for this year, eating up the remaining $600 and $2.4k of my deductible and OOP max, or;
2. schedule for January, which, depending on who in my life I ask and whether the surgery costs $4.5k or more, may or may not help me avoid medical expenses for the rest of the year.

My therapist took a look at my benefits and advised me that, should I hit my OOP max for 2023 with this surgery, I could possibly avoid copays and prescription costs for the rest of the year (I am a medically complex individual and pay a minimum of about $250/month for medical expenses between office visits and medication). My mom is pretty skeptical of this and does not believe that copays or prescription costs are affected by my OOP max being met or not.

I am also pretty attracted to the idea of being able to just swipe my FSA card in January and pay for the whole (or most of the) procedure up front, but that puts me in a tight spot if my mom is correct and I am still responsible for copays and prescription costs afterward.

If it matters, I have a $25 copay for my PCP and therapist, $50 for specialists, and the most expensive of my medications is $12.50 for a 30-day supply."

lichprince_sf80dv,"Asking on behalf of my DM.

We got into a discussion tonight during our session regarding passive abilities, and now we’re kind of stuck. A player asked if, when we roll lower than our passive perception or investigation, we can just take our passive score. For example, my fighter has a seventeen passive investigation; under this logic, if I rolled a sixteen or lower, I’d just take seventeen instead. It would be impossible for me to get any *lower* than a seventeen. We all agreed that that sounds reasonable, but we were wondering if that breaks the game somehow.  

Part of the reasoning here is that, if I can “roll” a seventeen when I’m not paying attention or actively investigating, why would I be able to get any lower when doing so with intent? My DM agrees, but again, we wanted to make sure this wouldn’t dramatically unbalance our game."

One of my players is playing an elf fighter with the knight background and has brought two retainers into Barovia with him, one of which his character is romantically involved with. This retainer's name is Tobir. They have been boyfriends for the better part of a century. 

The party is currently inside Death House, but Tobir was left outside to look after the children. Because I believe having the retainers would give this character an unfair advantage, I plan on killing the one inside the house in the basement dungeon and having Tobir just be gone when they exit the house. I also think losing this link to his backstory/the ""outside"" world will add to the horror. This is where I'm struggling a little, though. The children and Tobir will have disappeared, but I'm stuck on what to do with him from there. Killing him outright seems both cheap and wasteful, so I'm looking for something, for lack of a better term, evil. The player is a D&D veteran and knows that I'm planning on doing something with both retainers, just isn't aware of what.

We have been in a LDR for quite some time now, but we've never had to really deal with mingling finances in the way that we expect we'll have to once we live so close to each other. We'll go from seeing each other two or three times a year to two or three times a month, which makes the burden of paying each other back for things a lot heavier than it historically has been. Just last week, he loaned me $50, and the fee to send it was $6 each way. This is obviously something we'd like to avoid going forward, as nobody likes paying fees. Venmo, Zelle, etc., don't work internationally.

My boyfriend's suggestion was to open a joint bank account based in one of our two countries to avoid dealing with the issues that come with moving money across borders, but we agree that combining finances in such a tangible way is pretty intimidating.

What, if any, other options are there for addressing this?  Ideally, we won't have to pay fees just to be together."
lichprince_bha1ie,"I just signed my first ever lease for a house in New York. My landlord has provided me the option to pay my monthly rent via Venmo or PayPal, and I'm leaning toward this just for convenience's sake. Is there any glaring detriment to doing things this way? Am I leaving myself open to legal problems? Thanks so much!"
lichprince_bcim02,"I'm transferring to UB next fall, and I'm pretty much guaranteed to be taking APY 106 with Joshi. She has terrible reviews on Rate My Professor, but I'm an anthropology major, and she's the only professor teaching that course. Does anyone here have any experience with her, or should I just take the Rate My Professor ratings as truth and prepare for the worst?"
lichprince_b4142j,"I had an appointment today with Aspen Dental, and these are the procedures they said I need:

* Cleaning with gingival irrigation (for some reason includes a fancy toothbrush)
* Seven surgical extractions, including my four impacted wisdom teeth and one molar that's pretty much shattered (some are listed on my bill as ""impacted completely bony"" and others as ""impacted partially bony"")
* Three crowns (""porcelain/ceramic zirconia"")
* Four fillings (""3 surface anterior"")

Before insurance, all of these procedures are well over 10 grand, but after, they're $3,600. I've never had any extensive dental work done before, though, and I'm unsure if this is a rip off, especially with all of the terrible things I've heard about Aspen Dental."
lichprince_a3toig,"My 50 y/o uninsured mom is currently in the hospital recovering from acute kidney failure that resulted from E. coli, contracted from a salad served by a local restaurant chain. She's been hospitalized since Monday and won't be released until Saturday at the earliest. Assuming she's released Saturday and able to return to work next Monday, which I doubt, she'll miss 5 and a half days of work. Both the nephrologist and infectious disease specialist have cleared her, meaning that the E. coli is no longer in her system, and her kidneys will recover. We're located in Florida.

A family friend recently brought up the idea of suing to us, and I'm interested to know if we have any legal recourse to do so. We don't have the receipt from the restaurant proving she purchased a salad, but it was paid for with her debit card. I don't care about getting a settlement, I just want her medical bills paid for."
lichprince_9yat4f,"I'm currently working seasonally at a fairly popular retail chain, and one of the requirements named during the interview was that I'm available to work on December 26. I desperately needed a job, so I neglected to mention to my now-manager that, 2 weeks prior, I'd booked a flight to another country, leaving 7 AM local time on December 26. However, now that I've been working there for over a month, I really like it, and I'm hoping they'll ask me to stay on after the holiday season is over. The problem is that I have still not talked to any of my managers about my flight. I have absolutely no idea how to handle this, and I'm soul-crushingly stressed out over it. I do, however, accept full responsibility for the situation. They established the terms of my employment on day one, and I got myself into a pickle by being dishonest. I still want to try to salvage it, though. Is there any way that I can?"

* My balance subject to interest rate is $927.01
* My total closing statement balance was $1668.27
* I have $163.93 in pending charges

What does all of this mean? I'm going to be able to pay my entire balance off in full next Wednesday, but I'm worried about how much interest I'm going to be charged in the meantime. Am I going to be charged another $19 every single day between now and next week?"
lichprince_9d2a44,"Earlier this summer, in June, my mom (a single mom with no support from my father for the past 9+ years) unexpectedly lost her job and less than a week later received news that her father had passed away. For the past few months, she, my sister, and I have been able to get by draining our savings and scraping our limited funds together week by week. However, a few days ago, our only vehicle quit on us with zero warning, and we had to shell out the money we had set aside for rent and bills to repair it, as getting around is essential to all of our lives (school, work, so on). We're now late on rent, and our water bill is in danger of being disconnected, too. We're really at a loss on what to do right now and very scared for our future. We've been homeless before and really don't want to end up in that situation again. Any help anyone can throw our way is very appreciated.

lichprince_9d0u0u,"As written, Victor is kind of boring. He's a nerdy, withdrawn, awkward boy who's accidentally killed two people and seemingly resents his parents while definitely resenting the valley of Barovia. He also apparently drove Stella Wachter crazy just by being mean to her. That's practically all the information we get on him, and I think it makes for a very lackluster character. I think he deserves better than that.

I know the prevailing interpretation of our young Victor is probably [/u/guildsbounty](https://www.reddit.com/r/CurseofStrahd/comments/8eex9m/alternate_very_negative_take_on_victor_vallakovich/)'s, but that wasn't a character that I thought would resonate with my party. I ended up going with a gentler, significantly more neutral version of him, and now he's embroiled in a romance with our warlock. Some of my favorite aspects of our Victor:

* His skeletal cats aren't just experiments, but pets that he genuinely loves and cares for. He ""pets"" them by stroking his fingers carefully down their spinal column, and they give him very rattly purrs in thanks.
* He hates his father and pities his mom, but pretends to despite the both of them in an attempt to repress any sympathy he feels for Lydia. It's hard growing up in an abusive house; it does weird stuff to the way you process emotion.
* He feels genuine remorse over the deaths of their servants and only tried a second time because he truly thought he'd fixed the problem. When he revealed to our aforementioned warlock what he'd done, he quickly broke down in tears.
* When the church went up in flames during St. Andral's Feast, he used *cone of cold* to extinguish the fire (but not before he could save his uncle).
* To better flesh out the political tension in Vallaki, I had Fiona hire the party for a fetch quest. She wanted them to retrieve a ledger, detailing the inhumane punishments Vargas gives his prisoners, from his library; our Victor aided in the party with their heist by sitting down for dinner with his parents for the first time in months. His mom was pretty overjoyed, and the party got in and out with proof of Vargas' misdeeds with no issue.
* He did experiment on Stella and thus caused her madness, but he's remorseful for that, too. If he gets the opportunity to apologize to Fiona or even Stella herself, he will, but right now, he's too ashamed.

Maybe this is too soft of a take on Victor, but I empathize with his moodiness; after all, wouldn't you be a little glum, too, if you grew up with Vargas Vallakovich as a dad?

DMs of the subreddit, how did you run Victor? Players, did you spend a lot of time interacting with him, or was he an NPC that you just sort of brushed aside? I think he has the potential to be an extremely compelling character, no matter what direction you choose to take him; it's just a matter of taking the time to flesh him out."
lichprince_93w4fo,"Tonight, my players had a dinner party with Vargas, his family, and Ireena, before most of the plot hooks had dropped. They have no idea the bones are stolen, haven't met Fiona Wachter, and have only an inkling of the situation with Izek and Ireena. However, the party ended abruptly early when one of my players was thrown in the makeshift dungeon in the mansion and the other three were kicked out. They'd been hearing of wolf attacks throughout town and were attacked by a small pack of wolves on their way to the cleared out windmill for shelter, which almost resulted in a TPK. I'm at a bit of a loss on where to go from here. Basically all of the plans I made were made under the assumption the dinner wouldn't result in them getting thrown out of Vallaki. Help?"
lichprince_924sub,"So, last night, we had our first player death, thanks to Morgantha and her daughters, and the next round, he was resurrected by the dark powers of Barovia with a dark gift, full HP, and all of his spell slots restored. I got a little bit ahead of myself and explained the mechanic to my players, telling them that for every death, they have the choice to die or to be brought back a bit different. It's only supposed to be until level 5, but I love the narrative implications of it so much that I'm planning on using it for the whole campaign and told them as much.

This is where things get sticky. Our warlock, who'd just been resurrected, claimed that freebie resurrections like this break the game and make healing pointless, because they're functionally immortal and will never choose to just die. I don't want to scrap it entirely, but I kind of see his logic, especially since his gift was one of the tamer ones. Part of me thinks each player ought to get one free resurrection from the dark powers of Barovia, but after that, they're on their own. Or maybe there's a DC, scaling in difficulty with each death. I don't know, I'm a little lost on how to fix this and make the stakes feel real without completely throwing out a mechanic I really, really like. Any thoughts?"
lichprince_8zfy3m,"I already posted this over at the Curse of Strahd sub, but I'm still unsure what to do. Last session, two of my party members ate enchanted, addictive meat pies sold to them by a conniving night hag. They knock their consumers into a dreamy, magical sleep for 8 hours, and I'm planning on kicking our next game off with a dream sequence to reflect that. I don't want it to be nightmarish, because it is Curse of Strahd we're playing, and I don't see why Barovians would be addicted to pastries that give them nightmares if the land they live in already is nightmarish in its own right. I'd ideally like it to be goofy (and relatively short), but I'm at a loss with where to start. Anyone have any ideas?"
lichprince_8yq23m,"Last week, two of my players ate dream pastries, and I want to have fun with it! I plan on kicking off our next session with a goofy dream sequence, kind of like tripping on acid, and I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on what I could do with it. I've never seen anyone suggest/pursue something like this before in this sub, so I'm a bit at a loss."
lichprince_8t0j8x,"A couple nights ago, my group had a less than stellar session. There wasn't anything particularly awful about it, it was just weird and altogether a little unfocused/unproductive, despite my best efforts as DM. Multiple people expressed to me afterward/among ourselves that it felt a little off, and although we spoke about it and trying to be better next time, it's been bugging me. How do you bounce back after a weird/not so great session?"
lichprince_8n42cm,"Tomorrow night, my group and I are heading into our second session of Death House, and we'll probably end up in the dungeon with the Decayer before the session is over. One of my party members is a Raven Queen warlock and has been using and abusing his spirit raven for all its worth. It can be slain, but simply comes back after the character's next rest. My question is this: would other DMs here allow the sacrifice of the spirit raven to the cult, given that it's not an illusion and is capable of dying? Or would that cheapen the decision whether or not to sacrifice something/someone? Or would you rule it a smart approach to the dilemma presented in the Dursts' basement? Any feedback would be appreciated!

Edit: Grammar."
lichprince_52phik,"So, I love D&D, and I'm looking at trying out Dungeon Mastering, but I'm short a few players. Right now, I have one confirmed PC who will be playing a human fighter, a second maybe, but I'd like to have a total of 3 or 4 players, with 5 as my absolute max. I'm a gothic horror type of gal, so I'm currently preparing Curse of Strahd, but the ideal situation would be one where we can continue the campaign after finishing the module. For the sake of our own comfort, we (my player and I) would prefer girls between the ages of 18 and 22, but that's not a solid rule; if you're cool, there shouldn't be any issues if you're not a late teens/early twenties lady.

Then he said ""you are human garbage""
Then he added ""you are mentally ill you are shit you are mentally disabled""

Whenever I detect any sign of the slightest disliking in people, I start hating them a lot.

And if I actually do get abandoned (ex. friends blocking me, situationship dumping me, etc) my anger issues literally explode like massive volcano.

I get angry sometimes. I get explosively, vehemently angry sometimes. 

In one day, in 24 hours, my mood change from very happy to very angry. 

And usually my anger arises from specific, very negative, past events.

From 9th grade to 12th grade, I got severely bullied by my entire schoolmates and the school girls mocked my looks a lot. Also, in my adulthood, dudes in romantic / dating relationships treated me like shit because of my looks. All this shit baffles me until to this very day and I suffer so much. I get so easily exploded and angry whenever topics about looks come up. When I take a selfie and it looks ugly I literally throws temper tantrums and I cry in my room for like two to three hours. I literally explode when my selfies look shitty and unsatisfactory.

I AM EXTREMELY AFRAID OF HE DOING HIT-AND-RUN AND ME ACTUALLY BEING HIS REBOUND GIRL.

I DONT KNOW WHAT TO DO NOT AT ALL 

AM I HIS REBOUND GIRL?"
jiisawesome_yzd6on,"TL; DR My crush said he likes me multiple times. He wants to go on cute dates with me. Is this boyfriend girlfriend stuff?



So.. I am Asian female. 


In my culture, when a guy and a girl like each other guy actually meets a girl and says ""I like you. lets be boyfriend and girlfriend""



And IDK how american dating / relationship culture works.


My crush (ohio person) told me ""I like you"" like three or four times so far? And said stuff like ""you are precious"" ""you are pretty"" and stuff. 


2 weeks ago he told me ""lets go to a bar and play beer pong.""


And today...
I told him ""I wanna watch movie with you and go on cute dates""
My crush said ""I want to watch movies and go out on cute dates with you too""


Is this a relationship? Like is this process how American make their boyfriend and girlfriend?



Like I am extremely confused coz he never used the phrase ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" in the entire conversation. He did NOT use the phrase ""boyfriend and girlfriend.""


What is this thing? I am absolutely clueless. 


I really wish I am his girlfriend. I like him tons :("
jiisawesome_yxjn1s,"TL; DR: I told my crush I like him and my crush guy said ""I really really like you"" to me. What should I do now please help me

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

lol... I feel so dizzy right now I feel extremely nervous. So So it was kinda love at first sight. I (25f) immediately fell for him (21m) in like seconds. He is super nice and daamn he is awesome. We texted for like two and a half week. During that time, we had convo about our views about marriage, career and etc. We complimented each other's looks too. When I was really sick (I almost went to biggest hospital in my country, I almost ended up in er) He asked me if I am okay. He got worried about me.

&#x200B;

So today, we had convo. He asked me if I like him. I said yes. I told him I like him for his soul and looks. He said he doesn't ""kinda"" like me. He told me he ""really really"" like me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So what should we do now..? Is this a good thing in the states? How should I act? I mean I like him too much and I wanna see him as long as I can. (I am Asian I have no clue about American dates relationships and marriage.)"
jiisawesome_yvrokz,"TL; DR I am afraid of texting my crush ""first"".He compliments my look and personality but I dont think he likes me. Can I text him first?





So.. I (25f) have a crush. He is totally my type and he is perfection. and and my crush guy text me first from time to time. He compliments my looks and my personality.. but I am  not sure if he likes me or not. 

(Yes I am huge introvert and I have huge huge huge  abandonment issues)

I want to text him first. But I am afraid. What if he does not like it?
I am worried a lot.

(Yes I am living in Asia and in my country we belive guys should make moves first and lead a girl. I think like this as well.)

Idk what to do.."
jiisawesome_ybh7o6,"Sooo I (25f) recently met a dude (23m).
Everything is going well so far and he is perfect guy. He is handsome, tall, good personality and etc. He is absolutely 10 and everything is my type.

Today he told me that he broke up with fiance because of her cheating.

(Breakup was 2 yrs ago and it took him 1 yrs to process)

However I got some major issues. This year I dated someone (22m) for 2 and half months. He gradually started treating shitty to me and then we broke up. It turned out that he still loves his ex wife and I was the rebound girl and he went back to his ex wife.

Because of the aforementioned reason I cannot trust this new guy at all not at all (actually this new guy scares the fuck outta me) I think this new guy still loves his ex fiance and he is deliberately using me as a rebound girl.

What should I do?


TL DR; I think my new guy still loves his ex fiance what should I do?"

jiisawesome_y0a6fa,"
We (I 25f / he 24m) had first date last Tuesday and second date last friday.
The chemistry and everything was perfect. Then things got weird when I found out he uses two cellphones. At first, I didn't mind it at all.

But starting saturday (10/8) he has never texted me. The snapchat score remains the same. It seems like he deleted snapchat.

I miss him a lot. He is different from all the people I've met for 25 years.

What do you think the cause of problem is?
1. He got another attractive girl
2. He is busy with job
3. He has health issues."
jiisawesome_xzannb,"So.. he said I am friend, cuz he aint lookin for relationships. But anyways me (25f) and this guy (23m) had two dates so far. Everything was so perfect. The connection, attraction were just.. wow!!!

However as I went to his home this Friday, things sorta changed.

I noticed he uses 2 phones. (Idk if army officers have to use 2 phones for work) At first, I thought it was no big deal.

But like this saturday and sunday (today) he disappeared. His snap score it same for like 3 days straight.

Do you think he has multiple women other than me??"
jiisawesome_xq6m4i,"My (25f) crush (25m) told me I should not love him.

He already somehow know I am falling for him. 
So he said ""dont like me you gonna get hurt."" 
And I said ""Its never gonna happen not at all ""

But the confusing thing is when we hang out he treat me like gf, while in fact we are just friends.


I am confused what kind of emotion is he feeling toward me..? Can somebody tell me?"
jiisawesome_xlyrr1,"My (25f) fwb dude (25m) invited me to party where his coworkers and friends are at. I asked him whether I can date the cutest one there. He said ""hell yeah.""

Why is he doing this tho? Is he tryna mock and insult me infront of his friends??"
jiisawesome_xky9mr,"I am 25f and my fwb is 25m.

From the beginning he wanted fwb and he told me that. I said ""fine whatever"" and I met him.

However here is the problem. He is super hot and what is worse is that he is wayyy too kind and nice.  He doesnt treat me like fwb but like gf.

And I.... caught feelings.... lots of feelings. 

Help me please."
jiisawesome_xesmxm,"I recently met this dude from us and he is super hot.

Thank you in advance"
jiisawesome_vsr3ec,"I (25m) have been dating my bf for like 2 months. Everything has been perfect so far.

recently he changed a little bit (texting less, not expressing love to me) but I just ignored his behavior

Then today, I found out that my bf did not block his ex-wife. They have no kids but She constantly reaches to him. but he ignored all of her messages
(""Ignored"" is the phrase he used)


Soooo I assume that my current bf still loves his ex wife. 
But before breaking up with him, I need you guys' help
Any advice??"
jiisawesome_uw3byn,"So I(25f/asian) recently started dating a person (23m/american). Everything has been perfect so far and I really like him. He is sorta my first official boyfriend. 

However I do have concerns and worries.
First he said he likes bdsm
Second he said he has fetishs for school girl uniform. 

Is this red flag? Should I run away?"

However, the more I study in graduate school, the more I think I am dumber and intellectually inferior to my colleagues. Now I am doing second semester of ma degree and I am pretty confident that i am dumber and intellectually inferior than the vast majority of my colleagues. 
I doubt that I can make any meaningful contributions to my field, ever in my lifetime.

I am 25f (asian) planning to do MA Phd in the states in 2024. 
I wanna meet my spouse while Im doing my MA PhD in America.

So my question is where do Americans find their partner / spouse?

※ I sincerely refuse dating apps
I tried dating apps and met US soldiers in korea and all of those attempts were total disaster. I ended up going to therapy and taking meds lmao."
jiisawesome_qonn3e,"Back in 2019 I (24f/asian) loved him (23m/usa) dearly. I loved him a lot. Of course, he took advantage of me sexually and economically. 
He tried to burn my chest me and he said mean shit to me a lot. But I couldn't let go of him and somehow let him take advantage of me sexually for 5 months.

Then, he went back to America. 

In 2020, he became baby father. 

In 2021, he came back to my country.

Today he messaged me first and told me he became baby father. 
He says he loves baby and his baby mama.

So it turned out that someone whom I loved dearly gave his love to other woman. 

It happens. Life can be like that. Life is pain. However, the fact that I was his doormat will forever ache me and hurt me.

 I will never forget his words' ""Look I don't want some goddamn love from you. I just want s#x.""


I dont wanna have an affair and s#x with this dude. Dont get me wrong please.

Its just that this whole thing that he used me as doormat and he never loved me crumbles my self esteem and self identity and emotion and everything.

Any advice?"

I like him a lot he is such a perfection

Orion9092_1au2od9,"Brrchain is an emerging cryptocurrency protocol that is making waves in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space with its innovative approach to liquidity provision and trading. The protocol is set to revolutionize the way traders and liquidity providers interact with digital assets through its initial supply distribution via rewards in a liquidity pool, commonly referred to as a farm. The unique aspect of Brrchain is its initial focus on rewarding participants in specific pools: BOOBIES, TGUY, and HORSEMEAT.

&#x200B;

The core appeal of Brrchain lies in its promise to enhance the trading experience by offering better order routing, tighter spreads, and more favorable pricing for those trading coins or liquidity provider tokens (LPs). This is a significant advancement as it aims to reduce slippage and improve profitability for users engaging in swaps and liquidity provision.

&#x200B;

As of today, Brrchain has taken a significant step by launching the first BRRR/Boobies pool. This initiative allows users to engage directly with the Brrchain ecosystem by providing liquidity to the BRRR/BOOBIES pair and, in return, earning rewards in BRRR. Participants have the flexibility to farm these rewards, compound them for further earnings, or sell them as per their strategy or financial goals.

&#x200B;

However, potential users should be aware of the risks associated with liquidity provision, notably impermanent loss. Impermanent loss occurs when the price ratio of the assets in a liquidity pool changes from when they were deposited, potentially leading to a loss if the liquidity is withdrawn. Despite this risk, Brrchain offers an innovative approach to mitigate it through the introduction of a BOOBIES/SOL pool in the coming days. This will enable users to farm rewards without the need to purchase BRRR directly, providing a more accessible entry point into the ecosystem.

&#x200B;

Looking ahead, Brrchain plans to expand its pool offerings to include Horsemeat/Boobies and TGUY/Boobies pairs. This expansion strategy signifies the protocol's commitment to diversifying its liquidity provision options and enhancing its ecosystem's attractiveness.

&#x200B;

Details about the full capabilities and features of Brrchain are set to be unveiled over the next month, building anticipation and engagement within the community. The protocol's hard launch is scheduled for a month from now, marking a significant milestone in its development and offering potential for substantial impact on the DeFi landscape.

&#x200B;

In conclusion, Brrchain represents a promising development in the DeFi space, offering innovative solutions to common trading and liquidity provision challenges. Its approach to initial supply distribution, coupled with the promise of improved trading conditions, positions it as a protocol worth watching. However, participants should carefully consider the risks, particularly impermanent loss, when engaging with liquidity pools."

I had posted here not long ago about how Hurricane Ian destroyed my Pokemon cards, and how I was going to try and recollect them. Well I decided to try and document that on Youtube and if anyone would like to go on the journey with me on doing pulls from packs, boxes, auctions, etc. Well here is the first video. This is my first video I have ever done, so please be gentle. I will be doing a top down camera view from here on out. Either way enjoy me opening stuff from ShopGoodwill.

Orion9092_18uow7e,Been a warm year but hopefully we stop getting rain and can finally play in the snow (Maine). How's the winter to been for you?
Orion9092_18ozk3a,"  About half a year ago I traded my '22 ecodiesel Laramie for a '20 Limited Hemi. The ecodiesel was 4x2 and I needed 4x4 due to moving up north. I kept seeing across reddit, Facebook, and news articles about people being up in arms about the new twin turbo V6, electric, or just plain any engine that wasn't a Hemi. Plus all the backlash that FCA RAM has got for ""killing"" the Hemi. With all the love I expected that it was going to be waaaay better than the ecodiesel and other trucks I have driven (my father has an F150 with the Ecoboost V6).  

  Sadly I don't see what makes it so great. I don't think it's necessarily bad. It's not any more, or any less reliable than most options in trucks today. It gets horrible gas mileage. The power output is decent, but not staggeringly good. It's relatively smooth, but I wouldn't call it quick, especially when compared to the Ecoboost. So if another engine can tow just as much, if not more. Get better fuel economy. Has more power. And is probably a quicker truck, why hate on it so much?  

  Obviously a V8 sounds good, but I don't think it's the best sounding thing in the world. Especially stock. Am I missing something?  Or is this just a case of ""I don't like change, get off my lawn""?"

Orion9092_13titpg,"Hey y'all!

Thanks to some good advice from some forum members here, I traded my beloved 2022 Laramie 4x2 with the ecodiesel to a 2020 Limited 4x4 with the HEMI due to moving from Florida to Maine. While I will miss the diesel and uconnect5, the other features more than make up for it. Plus it brought my payments down so it's a win/win."
Orion9092_13sm35j,"I went to look at 4x4 options seeing my '22 Laramie is 4x2 and I am moving up North.  Its seems that similarly equipped Rams are no longer similarly equipped/priced.  The deals right now have the price far under what I paid for mine, but some materials feel cheaper inside and you have to step up to higher tiers to get the same features I had on lower tiers.  Even the Limiteds had less unless you step up in tiers.  Every '22 limited I looked at last year had radar cruise control, chrome door inserts, bed liners and lights in the bed.  Now they are all absent.  Hell even the wood grain on the steering wheel is gone.  So if you have a '20-'22 i'd say keep it.  Other than a digital gauge cluster (which I am not a fan of) the '23s are a downgrade.  Anyone else feel this way or am I just nit picking?"
Orion9092_13q6vvm,"Hey everyone.  For the past year I have been enjoying my '22 4x2 1500 Ecodiesel with the 3.92 gears and anti spin differential in Florida.  It has the 22"" tire option. However, I will soon be moving to Maine to be closer to family and was wondering if I should try and trade for a 4x4.  I am not new to driving in snow, but most of my vehicles have been FWD hot hatches, now RWD trucks.  Do any of you drive a 4x2 in the winter?  I know I will probably have to load up the bed.  


\*\*\*Update\*\*\* After seeing the financing specials that they have, it is actually cheaper to trade in to a 4x4 Laramie Etorque than to stay in my 4x2 Laramie Ecodiesel.  Thank you all for your opinions and confirming my suspicions. "
Orion9092_13cc445,"Snoop is the bigger one. We rescued him from a shelter when he was about 11 months old. He was red tagged ""use caution"" from the handlers, meaning he rarely got out. The handlers even had to lock him in a room when we went to see him because they didn't understand that he had a lot of excitable energy from being locked up all day. However he has been, and always will be a big baby to us and everyone else. As soon as he got food (he was all ribs at 41lbs when we got him), and love he settled down into the bestest boy ever.  He is now a healthy 61lbs, although has severe allergies. 

Taz (obviously the little one), was found behind a hospital close to the highway. We were already looking to adopt a second dog, so we thought it unfair to adopt a dog just to put another dog in the shelter. So we kept the little sh*t.  We called him Taz because he growls and plays like a little Tazmanian Devil. Not the cartoon, the actual kind. He is a tenacious goofball, that loves his brother more than anything. I guess he likes us too.  

We have introduced so many people to the bully breed with these 2.  One of which is my fiancees mom who was afraid of dogs. Now they both sleep in her lap during visits and she gets mad if we don't bring them. 

For those curious we DNA tested them both.

Snoop is:
45.3% APBT
31.5% Rottweiler 
8.4% AMStaff
5.6% GSD
9.2% Supermutt (boxer, Doberman, other)


Taz is:
11.7% Supermutt (bulldog, gsd, shitzu)
17.8% American Bully
14.9% Russell Type Terrier 
14.7% Chihuahua 
10.3% APBT
13.1% Chow Chow
8.8% Catahoula Leopard Dog
8.7% Yorkie

Let's show the world how good these dogs can be. Whether ""purebred"", or Supermutts."

My fiancé and I are both Navy Veterans with a combined 12 years of service. We met over drinks, as sailors normally do. We fell in love, adopted a cat and two dogs, and started our life together. We wanted to get a place of our own, have a yard for the dogs, get married, start a business, have a family, the usual. 

Life pushed us a bit faster than we would’ve liked due to extreme rent hikes. Our 2/2 apartment increased rent, again. We thought if they were going to charge us more than a monthly mortgage, we should at least look to see if we could qualify for a house. After months of searching, deals falling through, and heart breaks, we finally found a house that met our needs. Hurray! Getting our first house was a big win, it took every last penny and then some, but we were overjoyed to call it ours. 

The house was owned by a former Veteran who passed away, the children who inherited the house liked that it was being taken over by a young Veteran couple getting ready to start their lives (their words, not mine). It was a unique, beautiful older home; We fell in love with the charm and couldn’t wait to make it ours! We started cleaning the yard, painting the walls, decorating, and settling into our home. We were finally able to make steps toward having a family and life together, but Ian had other plans for us. 

On Tuesday the 27th Englewood started evacuating zones A and B. We were C. We had already gone to Home Depot to get plywood for the windows, but the shelves were bare. We prepared the best we could. We nailed tarps over the windows to try and save them, turned on the news, and hunkered down. We had no idea of the nightmare ahead of us. 

Everything was fine, until it wasn’t. Around 12 p.m. on Wednesday 28th we started getting news that the eye of the hurricane took a turn and it was going to be significantly closer to us and stronger than predicted. The winds started to pick up and shred the mature trees on our property. Water started to seep in from the interior walls, windows, and doors. 

We moved to the downstairs bedroom with the pets and stuffed whatever we could grab – clothing, towels, spare sheets, you name it. All in an attempt to soak up water that kept leaking in. Suddenly, one of the upstairs windows blew out; The pressure from the 155+ mph winds slammed every door shut and the house started to pressurize. 

We grabbed the pets and moved to the most central room in the house. We heard the roof creak and flex, praying it didn’t come lose. We stayed there as the storm battered us for 6+ hours. The winds howling louder and louder. We laid there, praying for our safety, as we heard the destruction raging inside and outside of our home. We had no way out. There we stayed with no power, no cell signal, helpless, as Ian destroyed our beloved home. 

At midnight, we finally had a chance to move upstairs after receiving flash flood warnings. Battling the winds, we salvaged one of our remaining tarps and secured the broken window. We tried to get some sleep as the winds continued to howl. 

The morning of Thursday 29th, we were able to see the extent of the damage. Ian had destroyed everything we worked so hard for. Only a few trees survived, those that didn’t, blocked our cars and took our deck and exterior stairs with them. A piece of our roof laid flat in the backyard. The pressure from the intense winds blew out an exterior wall in one of our bedrooms, completely exposing it to the elements. Water and debris covered every surface, wall, and piece of furniture. 

We were lucky to have a drying and restoration company come out for a look to help with the insurance. They told us that the home is a minimum of a 70% loss. Nearly all our belongings are unsalvageable. Our home is unlivable. This is just the initial assessment. We are still waiting for the insurance company to do their assessments, which is weeks out. We have no home, no jobs to return to, and no idea what the future holds.  
 

We hope that anyone who reads this can donate to help us find a temporary home for ourselves and our pets. Any monies received will be used thoughtfully for essential living needs: rent, food, medications, clothing, toiletries, etc. 

We are determined to rebuild our lives. No matter how small the donation, we are thankful for all support during these trying unsure times. We and our pets are truly lucky to have made it out without a single scratch, and we count our blessings every day because of it. 

We pray for our families, friends, and surrounding communities.

Thank you for your love and support. 

\- Joshua, Zeny, Mira, Snoop, & Taz"

Orion9092_nx4njk," So I normally do not post about investments, however this project is unlike anything I have been a part of thus far. With just a small investment I have been able to claim over $10 in BNB rewards for 4 days now. Most cryptos will only reward you with THEIR own coins, never in BNB. This freedom allows you to reinvest into more SHIELD, other crypto projects, or even just sit on it as a form of passive income. As always DYOR, but if you want in, the time is now before the CMC listing.

🚀🔥Welcome to Shieldtoken 🚀🔥

A 5 day old cryptoproject where you earn passive income by just holding

🛡️ 8%

BNB Reward

8% of every transaction is taken and converted to BNB and then redistributed to all SHIELD holders. The BNB can be withdrawn every 24 hours.

🔒 6%

Autolock (LP)

The volatility of the price reduces as more liquidity is added, therefore 6% of the tax will be converted into a BNB/SHIELD liquidity pair

🔐

Highly Secured

All initial Liquidity Provided by DxSale will be locked with DxLock in several stages to guarantee liquidity.

100% Rugsafe

Get in before the listing on CMC and profit later💪🚀

My fiancé and I are trying to buy land to start a small scale farm on. We are both US Navy vets with over 12 years of combined service. After getting out I went to school to become a Chef, for which I have been for 5 years. I have noticed so much waste in the industry that I started donating any old product to homeless veterans in the area. This sparked the idea to create a small scale farm to sell amazing produce to local restaurants. Any leftover product from both the farm and the places I deliver to will be donated to those in need. We also plan to hire, clothe, and feed any Veterans in need in our area. However, COVID and rising real estate prices keep delaying our ability to make this dream a reality. Even if it’s 1 VET it will be going to bettering the lives of those who have served

hungrycarebear_1dgazr0,"I have my attack at 800, attack delay less than a second, have 475 defense, but I cannot beat this thing. No matter how much damage I do, it'll just spam Stream of Healing nonstop till it's back near full. If you are going to give enemies healing, put it on the same cooldown as us."
hungrycarebear_1df7qla,"I'll be fully buffed, pouch full of good items, over level 40 in everything, but once he switches to stone, he never misses and just erases me. I tried going tanky, fast, and dodgy but nothing works. "
hungrycarebear_1delbjm,"Looking for a sci-fi, preferably with mecha or ships, following someone from the bottom up. Progression or litrpg are fine. "
hungrycarebear_1dcs3al,"I remember the titular hero had a stupid name, and one of the games was titled something like hero and the thong of power. Had to be early or mid 2000s."
hungrycarebear_1d9lwgd,"I've read hundreds of fantasy based litrpgs, but I could probably count the sci-fi ones on two hands. Are there any good spaceship or mech litrpgs out there? I loved 12 Below, Iron Prince, Godclads, and Reclaimer. "
hungrycarebear_1d60lnk,"This may be a dumb question, but I cannot figure out what suit of power armor is shown in the steam library banner for Fallout 76. At first I thought it was Union, but I finally saw what that looked like. Is it something already in game or is it coming in the next update?"
hungrycarebear_1d5cy0g,"We just got a golden doodle puppy, 8 weeks I believe, and our 8 year old shitzu seems to adore her already. The problem is she is drooling excessively around the puppy, and I was worried it was stress? I've had her around dogs and cats before with absolutely no reaction so I'm just a little concerned. "
hungrycarebear_1d31ns5,"I remember there being 2 sides to the galactic war, a peaceful union run by psychic squids, and then everyone who didn't want to be enslaved. They other races started using humans as their soldiers. "
hungrycarebear_1d293za,"For some reason, every time I try to join this event, even when I launch the nuke, it puts me in an empty instance. At first I was thinking, oh maybe it hit the 8 person limit? Nope less than 5 people participating. This is the third time. My brother and I walked into the mine at the same time and ended up in two separate instances. Is there a reason for this?"
hungrycarebear_1d0npb0,"

I'm running a Amd Radeon RX 6750 XT, ryzen 5 2600 six core processor, and 16 gigs of RAM. Is this enough to run this game between 30-59 fps? Sorry if this doesn't fit, I'm not sure where else to post this kind of question. "

hungrycarebear_1czrrv7,"I'm running a very low creative effort campaign for my group so everyone can still play since the big campaign ended and another player is working on the next one. So this campaign has no story, no big bad, and we are mostly using it to test things out and goof off. I've implemented realistic enemy tactics, making combat much more fun for them, but what other little changes should I make or try out?"
hungrycarebear_1cyy2ah,"I've been looking for a more sci-fi than fantasy litrpg lately. I'm looking for something stat and skill heavy. Nova Online was great, but Winter Harvest was a dud. While I don't mind an op mc, I want them to grow into it, not be it from the offset. "
hungrycarebear_1cyvipq,I finally hit rank 100 on the S.C.O.R.E. ranks. Is it even possible for me to hit rank 150 before the season ends? Or am I wasting my time?
hungrycarebear_1cohw6z,"Where in the world do I find plans for armor workbenches and chemist workbenches? I looked it up and saw they spawn at train stations near the workbenches there, but after several loops on multiple servers, I cannot for the life of me find them. Do any vendors sell them? Or do I need to just hope?"
hungrycarebear_1cjfabg,"After around 5-10 minutes of playing, the game will randomly decide to change the resolution. When it does this, it glitches out all icons and menu options and it won't go away until I relaunch the whole game. I tried setting the .ini file to read only after setting the resolution to what its supposed to be, but then it displays the game bigger than my monitor only when I put it in read only."
hungrycarebear_1ciplwa,"I'm experiencing a bug where prompts will vanish, all the icons get lined in half, and menu options have turned black. No mods installed, does anyone know how I can fix this?"
hungrycarebear_1cgy3di,"Usually whenever difficulty options are provided in a game, I pick easy or normal. But with Cyberpunk, very hard still feels very fair. I can't even touch the lower difficulties anymore, it's just not fun. Are there any other games with that kind of feeling? With Bethesda games it just turns everything into bullet sponges, and I honestly can't think of another game with memorable difficulty changes. "
hungrycarebear_1cfgbrx,"After about 5-10 minutes of play, all the the text on my hud disappears or gets cut in half diagonally,  I get no prompts, and in the menu, all the words are black. I've tried different resolutions and graphics settings, but it keeps happening."
hungrycarebear_1c81v1z,"I want to start working on a campaign for when the current one ends. What tips do yall have for running an academy based campaign? Also what would be the best way to do companions/dragons? I don't want to limit there classes and have it more as a 1st level feat, raising hatchling that grow with them. "
hungrycarebear_1c2dlxu,"Could someone give me a brief non spoilers explanation about what makes it so good? I'm about to start reading it, but it's size is daunting, and I don't want to make it halfway through and not like the system. "
hungrycarebear_1c0vca5,I'm willing to provide reasoning if asked. And I love recommendations. 
hungrycarebear_1bzxnae,"What pet peeves do you have for litrpgs and cultivation books? For me, I've developed quite a few over the years. If you're gonna use numbers for your stats, at least tell us the baseline and what increasing it actually does, or they just become arbitrary numbers. If you have levels, I want to see the MC start at 0 or 1, not some arbitrary, ""Oh you're a regular guy, level 36,"" right off the bat. Levels should mean something at least. Not counting that towards purposefully OP MCs, like System Universe. And don't get me started on town building. When it's done right, it's fantastic and fun. But otherwise it just feels like they shoved it in. "
hungrycarebear_1bvebpu,"I've played this game for over a decade now, and I'm finally trying to do a full playthrough, through the dlc, all factions. I'm thinking an evolving build, mostly a spellsword/battlemage build. But what limitations would help prevent burnout? One of my big ones, I try to minimize and avoid fast travel, using carriages and a horse. I usually only fast travel back to my closest home, drop things off, then trek out from there every time, so I try not to do it too much. Any build tips to keep an eye out for? Good suggestions on limitations? Anything but stealth archer."
hungrycarebear_1bvcuug,"I usually like to start the thieves guild and dark brotherhood as soon as possible, and do them together. Then I like to start the companions around level 20 or so, so I have enough health to actually werewolf around before curing myself at the end. Then I finish up the guilds with the Mages College, usually when I'm way too strong and just steamroll through it. I sprinkle the main story all throughout all this and I save the civil war for absolute last. And as someone who has played since day one, I still haven't made it to the Dragonborn dlc parts, cause I just never know where to put it. How about the rest of you? When do you start storylines? Any you absolutely skip?"
hungrycarebear_1bv0uig,"What homebrew rules do you always utilize or run behind the curtain that wouldn't be accepted by the wider community? And do your players know of them and/or enjoy them? For me, I don't run boss fights with hp, they progress in stages as feels earned. For instance say a player crits or does something ingenious, it immediately goes to the next stage. Otherwise, I go by general damage dealt. It gives my players that can't necessarily deal high damage a real reward for creativity, and it guarantees the boss fight goes on for as long as I need it to. "
hungrycarebear_1br6tyw,"I'm trying to find it. It had an actor playing a caveman that is so familiar on the tip of my tongue as well. I think it was an older Disney series, but it could be nick as well. "
hungrycarebear_1bqwwgy,"In my campaign, the big twist of the players that they have almost figured out is that they weren't brought back to life as champions of a God, but as gods themselves. This campaign is going to level 20 and they will fight the ""elder gods"" by the end. What are some small abilities I can give them that will grow with them? For our craftmaster, he can heal himself or constructs with a growing die pool with nanobots. Our gunslinger has been bestowed the ability to completely ignore resistances and immunities with her rifle(at a cost for her). Our necromancer gains a pool of temp hp for every point of damage he causes that he can spread amongst his summons. But I have a tank in power armor, an alchemist with bombs, a ritualistic investigator, a plush toy witch child, and a warfare with a strange affinity for fire? Any suggestions on those?"
hungrycarebear_1blig4c,I've been feeling like 100% the achievements on steam and feel overwhelmed when I start installing mods. Any tips?
hungrycarebear_1bl2u26,Has anyone found out when the timer for time sensitive quests starts? Does it only kick in once I accept the quest? Or could I sleep at the inn and completely miss a mission in another town? How long is the timer btw? Till the next story mission? Or is it in in-game days?
hungrycarebear_1bkrsxm,"I love a series where a character starts as one of the weakest beings in existence and grows and gets stronger. I loved the Underdog series, Ultimate Level One, All the Skills, and Solo Leveling, The Infinite World and especially Fleabag. I like an underdog who goes through hell and comes out stronger on the otherside. I am looking for something stat and skill heavy but nothing too sexual. "
hungrycarebear_1bi5fgb,"I love skill and/or stat heavy litrpgs, where someone rises from the bottom. I especially love if they are in a horrible situation and struggle. What recommendations do yall have?
Harems/overly sexual stuff is a no go for me. I'm also not a fan of comedy(I'm sorry Dungeon Crawler Carl, I tried to like you)
It doesn't even need classes, but stats and skills are necessary. I've gotten my progression/cultivation fix recently and now I'm hunting for litrpgs. 
Series I've read so far and like
1. The first 3 books of HWFWM(book 4 and 5 lost my interest)
2. Early Defiance of the Fall(then it got too much into cultivation territory)
3. A New World(Cmon Monsoon117 release book 2)
4. The Grand Game(is great, no qualms)
5. Necrotic Apocalypse(all great)
6. The Weight of it All. (The start of book 3 ruined it for me. When alot of the story is focused on the player figuring out tricks with his power, don't show us his future self with all his skills unlocked and explained.)"
hungrycarebear_1bhwj5x,"For me I've got at least 2 big ones. For health and crits. 
1. When players roll for HP, they reroll if they land on half or lower. For instance, a d12 could never get lower than 7+con.
2. I have been told I do crits oddly but in a fun way. A nat 20(or 19 if they can crit on that) is an automatic crit. And a natural 1 is an automatic miss. However, they can gamble it and roll another 1d20. On a crit, if they roll a 1 it's turned into a miss. On a 20, I will double the crit damage and they get to roll again. For crit misses, a 1 is a catastrophic failure, usually breaking or losing their weapon. A 20 turns it into a regular hit. "
hungrycarebear_1bgrfyc,"I'm having terrible restartitis,  and can't seem to figure out a non stealth archer build that would be good for doing the main story, Dawnguard, and dragonborn. And getting past level 80. I've been playing off and on since launch and I don't think I've ever cracked 50. I've over done stealth archer so much that I just can't do it anymore. But a plain mage and plain Warrior get boring fast and I don't really know how to mesh them without just defaulting into one or the other. "
hungrycarebear_1bfike6,"Going to use swarm mechanics for them, but what type of damage would they do? Should they bypass resistances? Acid almost seems right but it's not quite right. "
hungrycarebear_1bevzxh,I'm gonna try to do a survival playthrough as a breton bard starting in Windhelm with nothing but the clothes on my back. But I can never seem to figure out what difficulty meshes best with survival mode. What does difficulty change? Any tips?
hungrycarebear_1bd0i9r,"I know certain quests unlock at specific levels, but do any lock out at certain levels?"
hungrycarebear_1b7ke80,"
I am going to play through and try to 100% vanilla(plus DLC and anniversary content) survival run. I am new to survival mode and only know the basics. What race do you all recommend? Any builds useful? Any tips for staying alive and flourish? I don't know what difficulty I will play on, but the lowest it will go is Adept.   
Also are there any foods that are better for survival? Is Vampirism viable?"

hungrycarebear_1b5c3ly,"My players have entered a competition in the Dwarven capital. For one month, they are sealed in the tunnels and have to ""perform funerary rights"" for the deceased Dwarves. Effectively they are fighting golems and other constructs left when the Dwarves die. When they kill one, their marker will absorb its remaining power, adding to their point totals. Weak common enemies offer 1d4 points, stronger ones offer 1d10, and rare artifacts found in the catacombs might still have power so that's 1d20. For the points system, I have two dilemmas. 1. Should I let them use the points to pick out prizes, and what ratio do you think I should go for? 2. Should I show them previous high scores, or wait until I have a more reasonable estimate of their final score?"
hungrycarebear_1b0a292,"I'm looking for more of a litrpg than straight progression this time. I loved all of Divine Apostasy, Cradle and All The Skills, Randidly Ghosthound was great up till the latest book, got burned out on DotF, and I love HWFWM up until he made a big certain trip. I'm looking for something more serious, not a real fan of lighthearted or goofy series. I'm trying Apocalypse Tamer right now and I'm really feeling like it's gonna go goofy. I want the main character to struggle and grow in a stat heavy system. Also, not looking for harem or overly sexual  stories, those put me off like crazy. Thanks!"
hungrycarebear_1awm7ez,"My buddy is a bard, we are taking Karlach and Shadowheart along. I can't figure out what the party needs. What would you guys suggest?"
hungrycarebear_1av17e3,"I expected the fight with Bryce to be this big ceremonial thing, but nope just a few waves of goons followed by a pretty boring boss fight. Ebina's felt a bit better, but neither really felt like a real final boss."
hungrycarebear_1apzrjj,"In my campaign, the players are going to be invited to a major tournament. The tournaments whole reason is the people who host it are hoping the display of power will wake their god. Should I have it be team based or 1v1? I have a party of 8 players, and want this to be a huge event for them. How many participants would be feasible?"
hungrycarebear_19cohao,"I've replayed the game 3 times and I just do not understand a single thing Shania says. Her so called reasons make no sense to me. I'm obviously missing something, could someone dumb it down for me?"
hungrycarebear_1945zs3,"In stories with classes, I see so many necromancers and everyone side hustles as enchanters. What classes have y'all seen over and over?"
hungrycarebear_193lxyi,"My players will be looting a ruin of The First Age next session, so there's going to be plenty of modern and futuristic rubble in there. I've decided on a couple things that the party will be able to fix up like a suit of power armor and a laser rifle, but what would be a great artifact for an alchemist? I feel this is a perfect location for it, for it is ruins of an old research facility."
hungrycarebear_192olys,"I'm on my third play if the game right now, cause I sure do love the series, but I feel such a lull around the prison and the death of Mio², and two times before I just gradually played less and less at that point. I think it's the whole locked in feeling the back and forth in the prison that causes it. Does it open back up, and get back to how it was and about how far am I from the end?"
hungrycarebear_192mq7y,"I have made it to the prison break and the death of Mio² twice, and around that time I start to flag. How far am I in the story, and does it get better if I push through? I'm picking it back up because I love the other 2 games, but I'm really struggling to get past that part of the game."
hungrycarebear_1914qfr,"I'm on PC looking for a new jrpg to hold me over till Infinite Wealth. I love games where you can craft all the gear your party needs, and can change what role each party member fills. Star Ocean Second Story R almost scratched the itch but it was missing something. Fire Emblem 3 houses really gets the role part down but no crafting. I'm looking for something where grinding, gathering, crafting, and fighting take the fore front."
hungrycarebear_18yk03k,"In my campaign, as each God(ancient powerful beings above lvl 20, not actually divine) wakes up, the excess magic creates a magic item. Need suggestions and ideas. So far I have -
The Deep, God of hunger- Staff of gluttony- spells cast with the staff as the focus lower the max hit points equal to the damage

Apex, God of evolution- Bracers of Change- grants resistance to the most recent type of damage recieved. 

The Dreamer, God of magic- Tome of Dreams- allows the wielder access to one random spell of their highest spell slot 1/day
Titan, God of Improvement- ???

Spite, God of decay- ???

Soveriegn, God of the hive-???

Then it's not even an hour till you are at Vic's. But how long does it take V to recover from those events? A lot happens between the bullet scrambling V's brain and waking up after the mental tug of war with Johnny, like the Mayor getting attacked, River saving him, Mayor dying, all the stuff that happens with Evelyn, and Takemura's searches for leads while you recovered. I guess it takes place over at least 3 days, but no more than 10. Is there a more concrete timeline?"
hungrycarebear_18tu6yp,"In my campaign all the non human races are fairly new, only appearing in the last 1000 years. The ""elves"" are isolated in a very dangerous jungle with no real contact with the outside world, so I don't feel they should have the superiority complex or refined society. They've only had about 5 generations since they appeared, with the oldest and strongest sleeping(not enough mana to sustain them in the environment, that's changing) So would Appalachian Mountain men, or Louisiana Bayou be the better starting point for their culture"
hungrycarebear_18rqsxx,"I really felt like most of the book was a step back. It rarely brings up characters that used to have a bigger role in the story(alot of the residents of Donnyton, Neveah, or the bear girl) There feels to be too much build up towards certain things only to be dropped and forgotten about. And side characters are becoming more interesting and better written than the MC. This sucks cause this is my favorite Litrpg series and I think it started so well. Does anyone else feel like a Litrpg suffers when it brings in other planets or universes that have had the system for centuries already?"

hungrycarebear_18q3rul,"I've 100% DQ11 and Persona 5 and I need something to fill the void. I love games where I need to grind, be able to optimize through looting, farming, or crafting. I'm not a fan of games with multiple protags, like Octopath Traveler."
hungrycarebear_18pzrwz,"I'm looking for a good rpg where I can grind, craft or improve gear, but isn't split between multiple characters like Octopath Traveler. Jrpgs preferred.

I don't know why, bit I've felt compelled to do it ever since gen 3 on any run after my first clearing of the game. Anyone have any other traditions they do for every new playthrough?"
hungrycarebear_18g0ubq,"My villain is a robot that grew so obsessed with the humans of the first age(pre apocalypse and magic) that he believes he's one. His big plan is to wake the gods(ancient monsters) to harvest their energy to go back in time and stop the apocalypse. He has no guilt for all the death and destruction because when he succeeds, none of this will ever exist. He has chronomancy that will get stronger the more god's he wakes.

I've read most of the big names, and I'm starting Reborn as a Demonic Tree right now, so I'm in search of some new litrpgs. 
Not a big fan of comedy ones, definitely not a fan of overly sexual ones, and I definitely try to avoid overpowered out the gate MCs. I don't care if an MC becomes overpowered, but it's the climb to that I enjoy. I love when the mc has to fight to survive, with actual stakes. And stats. I'm a sucker for stat heavy, character sheet showing, level ups and achievements. 

So any suggestions?"

hungrycarebear_17vmtt1,"I'm curious as to what farming games this shares similarities with, what mechanics it has, and etc.   
Is there a ton of different things to do with your crops?(Brewing, Jams, Cooking, Composting, Juicing, Etc.) Is there a level system or a skill system? Is there health or stamina limits? Is there combat?"
hungrycarebear_17rhm1t,Are there any books where the main character is a monster and has to evolve and grow? Like  Chrysalis and Life Reset. But not taking place in a game? (Life Reset was great because it was his life. He was stuck and that made it real)
hungrycarebear_17qvx7e,"I'm looking for series where the main character starts at the bottom and has to struggle and survive. I don't mind OP but I want to experience the growth to it. Something gritty where death is an actual danger. Like the beginning of Project Chrysalis. Or The Grand Game. Nothing haremy or comedic. Unbound had a good start, but I felt like he rose to power way too fast."
hungrycarebear_17qt7sp,"I'm looking for a litrpg where the main character is put in the worst possible environment and has to survive. Something like the beginning of Project Chrysalis. Before he started all the dumb ""Oh I can just make my self unstoppable by doing this super easy thing""  I don't want an overpowered out the gate MC like System Universe. But I would be fine with a character using a weird ability to their advantage like All The Skills."

hungrycarebear_17n0z6t,I just got Star Ocean the second story R and as my first game in the franchise I am confused by certain things. What are talents and what do they do? Do I want to start with a lot or less? What's the best party for Claude? Is there a limited amount of sp or can I grind it infinitely? What's the best specialties for each character or should I make them all well rounded? Is there anything I should be on the lookout for so I don't miss something cool in the beginning?
hungrycarebear_17f2249,"These are my two favorites out of all litrpgs I've read, and I'm wondering if there are others that are similar? I love the rise from nothing, the creativity of the characters, and how all their strength feels earned. I dont like books where the MC is already overpowered like System Universe, just because I like seeing the struggle and challenges. Also please no harems."
hungrycarebear_17ezps8,"I love the litrpg genre, so much so that I have run out of series to read. I'm caught up on Defiance of the Fall, Unbound, Iron Prince, Life Reset, Divine Apostasy, Beastborne, Murderhobo, The Land, and a bunch of others. I'm looking for non comedic books, definitely no harem stuff, with good litrpg elements. Any recommendations?"
hungrycarebear_16txdrx,"Why don't they allow the use of external cyberdecks? Several netrunners are shown to have them, and it would open the slot for the Beserk and Sandevistan without loosing access to what feels like a major part of gameplay."
hungrycarebear_16rz3lb,"Will the dlc, not patch 2.0, add anything to the game prior to getting past the Transmission mission? I started my new game on Saturday and am about to the Voodoo Boys and I'm curious if I'm gonna be missing anything."
hungrycarebear_16ptrdc,"I'm undecided on when to start my new playthrough. I hear that the DLC content starts after the Voodoo Boys, so it'll take me a couple days of playing to even get there.

Also, why does every companion yell at you if you choose the Space Cows over the microbe? I felt that at least Sam would have supported the safer more natural option.   

2. The Hunter's Identity

I really feel that having it be a character you only heavily interact with before it's revealed was a huge missed opportunity. I interacted more with the Hunter when I bumped into him at the bar then I did with his identity. I feel like they should have made the Hunter a variant of Matteo.

hungrycarebear_16g1wrx,"That first boss is so broken. 9/10 fights against him he just fires bouncing bullets, takes a step, fires more bouncing bullets, repeat. I can't dodge them all, it completely shreds through both my revives. That 1/10 where he uses his other moves I can beat him easily, but the rng is so busted on those. Why do some bosses bullets despawn if they go off screen but others don't? Why won't they let the spinning blades block boss bullets? Why can't I beat this damn stage?"
hungrycarebear_16dk22q,"I'm stuck on level 78 because the first boss will just spam his bouncing bullets over and over so I can't avoid getting hit cause the screen is full. Why don't the spinning blades block boss bullets? 1 out of every 5 attempts he will actually use his other moves, but the rest of the time he just keeps spraying bullets till the screen is completely covered in them.How am I supposed to beat this guy without wasting all my revives?"
hungrycarebear_15zs0oq,"I'm currently romancing Shadowheart in my playthrough. I had the wine and kiss scene, she told me about Shar and wanting to be a Dark Justicar, constantly talks about butterflies in her stomach when I initiate conversation. 

But at the party, she just says we should have had more wine, it warms more than the fire. And when I go to bed, it just says ""Try and push these twisting thoughts of Shadowheart out of your mind."" 

Is that supposed to happen or does that end the relationship or something? On my last playthrough the party is where I got the wine scene so I don't know what happens if you already saw it."
hungrycarebear_15zdss2,"What are the pros and cons of getting the brand? I know it allows the use of certain gear, but what else does it do? Does it lock you into anything? Like the Harper's see it and go hostile or anything?"
hungrycarebear_15xvtr9,"Other than companion approval, what effects on story does slurping down some tadpoles and gaining squid powers have? I know about a specific tadpole that definitely changes things, but will the endings and story be the same if I gulp down every normal tadpole in a jar? Will it treat it the same as if I hadn't? I know that I will have to convince each companion that I'm stronger, but does the story keep track?"
hungrycarebear_15xh7z5,"I feel like I missed alot of companion interactions by not long resting every 10 minutes, so I was wondering if there was a good way to judge when to take a long rest. Or if I should long rest after every fight or cutscene."
hungrycarebear_15xdf7g,"During the party after saving the Grove, shadowheart rejected me, saying we don't see eye to eye. Gale says we don't have a deep enough bond. I have almost max approval with both, and I have done all the right things. My question is can the weave tricks scene and the wine scene trigger after the party or am I totally locked out of their romances?"
hungrycarebear_15w4fo2,"I have fairly high approval with all my party members, the lowest being trusted by Shadowheart and that's on the high end of the green. 

However, at the Saved the Grove party, Shadowheart acts like we don't see eye to eye(I don't think I've even gotten a single disapproval from her) Gale says we don't have a deep enough bond(He is actually maxed out approval for me because he never leaves my side)."
hungrycarebear_15sfw93,"I am completely unable to find a simple breakdown of the differences between the three difficulty settings. All I have been able to figure out is on Explorer you get +2 to your proficiency and everyone has lower health. That's it.

What are all the differences, laid out plain and simple?"
hungrycarebear_15seklg,"I'm making my bard and I notice that the mage hand doesn't indicate that it's once a short rest, just that it lasts 10 turns. Did they fix it? Or is the spell description deceptive in character creator and it will change when I finalize?"
hungrycarebear_15s8ak0,"What race would be the best mechanically and visually for bard? Like what races buffs go well with it, and which race looks best in the light armor and with the weapons. I purposefully exclude the woodelves because that's what every site says to use all because of the movement speed buff."
hungrycarebear_15s6yca,"Does anyone know if these problems arise if you play a short race?  


1. Camera not tracking correctly in cutscenes and dialog, treating it like you are a medium character instead.
2. Oversized weaponry, tools, and instruments. Do they look silly and large in the hands of the dwarves and gnomes or do they scale or just look fine?
3. Do characters actually look down at you or above your head?

I ask because I have experienced these problems before in games and I am just wondering if I need to worry in this game."
hungrycarebear_15s0hur,"Which dragonborn or Dwarven subrace works best for a bard?

hungrycarebear_15rgxud,"I'm trying to narrow down a build, and I am just overwhelmed with the sheer amount of options. 

With class, I want to do a bard or druid, leaning heavily to bard because we can eventually get two druid companions and I feel there would be some heavy saturation. 

Race wise, I am completely up in the air between a dragonborn or duergar. Which would be better visually and mechanically?

Do the weapons scale in size visually? Or will I be wielding weapons made for human sized folk? Would I be a dwarf wielding a rapier as long as I am tall? 

Do dwarves suffer the silly walk they did in DOS:2? And does the camera actually work well with the smaller characters?

How do dragonborn look the coolest and have the least racial traits? Not even darkvision? Does the resistance and breath weapon make up for it?

Sorry for the long rant post, I just can't really find much clarification about most of my dilemmas."
hungrycarebear_15rb71q,Are there any downsides to eating the regular tadpoles in jars to advance my illithid powers? Like does it change anything in the story? Or does the game react the same if I don't touch a single tadpole compared to scarfing them all down?

And for races, drow and half drow come up all the time, but rarely did any dragonborn choices appear. 

Does the game separate duergar prompts from Dwarven like half drow is from half elf?"
hungrycarebear_15l4m8b,"I'm trying to finish my character but I'm held up by several factors. 
1. Lack of voice differences. (Is there a way to just turn off the MCs voice?)
2. I like martial classes but I feel like I'd be losing out on a ton of content by not having enough skills or utility through spells. 
3. Racial abilities being just unbalanced. Teiflings and half elves seem like the only real viable races cause of all they get. Does this really matter in the long run?"
hungrycarebear_15kvp4k,"I'm trying to make a dwarf or a dragonborn, but the fact I'm stuck with the same posh soft-spoken choices instead of something gruff or even the choice to stay silent really ruins it for me."

I was wondering if I could go all the way through the mountain pass, knock out the Gith Creche questline, then go to the underdark for whatever is down there or vice versa.

The First Age shined and reached for the heavens, burning up their civilization like a shooting star.
The Second Age rose from the ashes and started to retake the world from the horrors their ancestors left behind and the terror's just arriving.
The Third Age has just begun.

You are nothing more than regular commoner's. It is well known that not everyone can flourish in this world, the rampant mana destroying their bodies. But for those blessed by the Old God's, mana is sought out. It fuels their growth, allows them to heal from deadly wounds in a matter of days, lets them perform divine acts. To avoid an early grave, learn to fear those with glowing eyes.

But for those living in Sanctuary, these are just stories and tales told around the fireplace. Sanctuary is a safe place, with very few dangers. Where the most common cause of death is natural causes. The most excitement comes with the traveling merchants, bringing news of the outside world. Or for those more willing to believe, the tall tales of the town's rambling drunk might light the fire of adventure in their hearts. The old drunkard tells of strange monsters and ruins just beyond the grove that protects the village. Dare you believe?"""

He was always pushed around and it pushed him to try and enlist in the military or the guard. Unfortunately, due to his lack of muscles and strength, he was sent away. A drunken mercenary overheard him lamenting about his troubles and decided it would be worth a laugh to try and see if he could survive even a week. He took him on and, to make it seem like it wasn’t a joke, informed his fellows to seem like they were going to train him. They ""taught"" him how to use a great sword and heavy armor, much to their great delight. After a few hilarious weeks, they started to grow tired of his fumbles and stopped humoring him. The leader of the mercs had recently heard of a great treasure, but it was trapped with a devastating curse. He finally saw use for the young scrawny man. They tracked the treasure and fought their way through the abandoned island to a dark cavern. They sent in Vincent to retrieve the treasure, certainly dooming him. However, instead of finding dangers, Vincent was able to walk down the cavern with his unearned confidence. Finding an old broken door, he entered a dimly lit room, a small hole in the ceiling allowing light to flow through. In the center of the room was a solid sapphire mask, in the shape of a dragon. Vincent, wanting to be the first to do something for once, took the mask and slid it over his face. It was at that moment that Vincent ceased to exist as he was. Memories and information burned into his mind, his bones cracked and his skin tore. His head conformed to the shape of the mask. The pain was so intense that he was unable to even scream.  Seconds melted into minutes and after what felt like an eternity, the monstrosity stood. He grabbed the great sword Vincent struggled to carry and easily hefted it in one hand. With a smile and a hunger that had not been sated for centuries, Skorn walked towards the smell of human flesh, chuckling as he twirled the sword."

Dead666Dash_1cv0vak,"Meine Uni hat mir anscheinend mein Zeugnis per Einschreiben zugeschickt (ich musste ihnen gerade drei Monate lang mit einem Anwalt drohen, lol), und sie behaupten, ich hätte das Zeugnis laut einer dubios aussehenden Sendungsverfolgungsnummer erhalten, die weder den Sendungsstatus noch meine Adresse anzeigt. Ich habe es auch nie erhalten. Ist das ein Fehler oder gibt es eine neue betrügerische Methode, gefälschte Sendungsverfolgungsnummern zu erstellen??"
Dead666Dash_1cdit2f,"Used study flair since it's about Ausbildung, sorry if it's the wrong one.


So, 2020-2024 I was at Kunstschule Wandsbek studying Kommunikationsdesign. Around 5th semester they revealed, that we won't be getting a Bachelor's degree (as it was told us we'd get) after all, so since the Abschluss didn't have any actual meaning other than sorta being very long, expensive Praktikum I didn't put in as much work. Fast forward to Abschlussprüfungen and I didn't pass, which was expected so it didn't affect me all that much. I still can get as much with a ""Ohne Abschluss"" Zeugnis as the ones who did pass the final Prüfung (which is just Trainee Programs, Praktika and maybe other Ausbildung).


The thing with the certificates is, they're all the same. Except for the fact that the ones who passed got ""mit Abschluss"" written in the last sentence, where the ones who didn't class got ""ohne Abschluss"", that's about it. 2 days after last Prüfung days everyone who passed got their Zeugnis, those who didn't were told to wait (weird, since it was the same thing, but whatever). When asked if I wanted to pick my Zeugnis up or if I wanted them to send it to my house, I said to send it to me (as the school is pretty far away from me and it wasn't on the way to anything else).


Fast forward a month, I finally got an Einschreiben letter from the school (as far as I know priority mail doesn't take a month to ship). I open it, it's the same Zeugnis as everyone else's, however it has the wrong name on it.
Around 2 years ago I legally changed my first name and changed the ending of my last name (I'm a trans guy). The school knew of the change, from then on whenever I asked for any Bescheinigung for any documents (Bafög, Familienkasse etc) they would have the new, current name on them, so I assumed the change was in the system. Apparently not.

Taking it as a system issue, I wrote them an email saying how I was disappointed that after waiting a month for a Zeugnis everyone else already got, I got one with the wrong name on it. I asked them calmly if they could issue me a new one, with my legal name on it. The secretary made a scene where she called me crying, saying how ""she would never do such a thing, she's so accepting of my people"" and I just said okay, that I'm not blaming her, and I asked if can I just get a Certificate that I attended the school without waiting another month for it. She said they'd deliver it to me as quickly as possibly.


Fast forward another 3 weeks, still no Zeugnis. The thing with the Certificate is, that even if you didn't pass the last test, it still lists off all the classes you took, which is very beneficial in my case (I did photography, and I want to do a praktikum at a photographer's), so me not getting the document is hindering my options of getting any Praktikumsplatz anytime soon. Yes, technically I can use the certificate with my old name on it, but then I'd have to provide the name change document as well, which is extra work, and I just don't want to out myself as trans everytime I apply somewhere just because my school is too dumb to change a name on a piece of paper.


With that being said; I wrote the secretary on Monday, asking when I can expect my Zeugnis to arrive. She never answered. So I used the Kontaktformular from the school's website to reach the school, who was the 2nd secretary I believe. I sent an email, asking when I could expect my Zeugnis to be sent out to me. The school spammed my phone, but I never answered because 1. I hate phone calls (I often misunderstand something) 2. It's an important topic, I want it all to be in writing. After she answered to my email with a ""we tried to reach you but you didn't pick up the phone"", to which I responded ""I didn't pick up because the subject is pretty important, and so I want everything to be in writing in case I'd have to get a lawyer involved."" And since that moment she started being SO rude, calling my ""tone"" bad (after I asked very valid question) etc.



In the next email I asked her if she could, in writing, tell me why 1. I'm the only student who had to wait so long for their Certificate 2. Why should I not get a Zeugnis for an Ausbildung I participated in and fully paid for. (Those were labeled as the ""frech"" questions). Yesterday, surprisingly, the 1st secretary finally responded and said that she sent out my Zeugnis per post. I thought it was finally over. But ofc it wasn't.



Today I open the letter, to find a COPY of a Certificate. It's a shitty copy, too. Black and white but as if you used the draft setting on the printer. At least the name is right. But 1. It's not the original and 2. They edited the text.



As mentioned, the Zeugnis were all the same, except some hat ""mit Abschluss"" and soke ""ohne Abschluss"" on it. On the first, original Zeugnis that I got (with the wrong name) stood ""[Vorname Nachname] hat der Ausbildung zur Grafik- und Kommunikationsdesigner:in ohne Abschluss beendet."" However, the new one on the copy reads ""[Vorname Nachname] hat die Abschlussprüfung nicht bestanden und die Ausbildung zum/zur Kommunikationsdesigner:in ohne Abschluss beendet.""

Of course the 2nd version is still correct, per se, but why suddenly change the text, making it the only Zeugnis with altered text? And you can CLEARLY see on the copy that they scanned the original Zeugnis and changed the text in photoshop (the font is different, it's even a little crooked).



I wrote the school another email, asking when I can expect the original Zeugnis to be delivered to me (implying that I'm not asking if I get one, but demanding one) and also asking for a written explanation why the text would be suddenly changed from the one every other student received/I received originally, even though I only asked for a change if my name to the correct, legal one.



But slowly I'm fearing they might ghost me again (usually they answered emails withing 10min, not anymore ig). And I don't know what to do. I don't have the money for a lawyer, I wish I could go there in person and raise hell but I just don't have the nerves for it (I'd start angry-crying and then they deem you ""emotional""). I genuinely don't know anymore what to do, I just want a Zeugnis with my name on it."
Dead666Dash_1ca6qnm,"I'm in a poly relationship with two guys (been close friends for a long while before officially getting together), I'm moving together with them soon. I love them, they always made my life easier and brighter and they're probably the first partners whose 'red flags' are just mild inconveniences and not something I'd be telling my therapist about. However, I've noticed that I've been pretty petty/jealous of their lives and experiences.


They didn't have it easy, they both had their struggles growing up, they had down moments, some things still affect them to this day and their struggles/traumas are more than valid and reasonable. I hurt for them whenever they tell me of them, I'm here to help them, cheer them up, just like they are there for me. The only difference is, they both grew up with money. They weren't filthy rich or anything, but they didn't have to pick and choose who gets to eat less every dinner, they had warm showers, their clothes didn't get handed down so often the last sibling to get it would be wearing vintage clothing. And most of the time I am happy for them.


I'm glad that when something in their fridge grows mold because they forgot to eat it (they can forget to eat stuff!) they can just throw it out without guilt. I'm so happy for them they can sometimes grab a pricey snack without looking at the price tag and worrying too much. I really am happy that they're living comfortably.


I myself am a 1st gen immigrant, and while we moved to Germany (from Poland) while I was 12, it took us a while to get out of poverty, but now we're lower-middle class going into middle class and I'm more than comfortable. But being poor isn't just ""not having money for stuff"", it kinda changes a lot, in the way you treat conflicts, how you react when sudden costs happen, your work-life balance, etc etc. Even when I live comfortable, the poverty mindset still surfaces.


Point being; sometimes I see my partners as ""being pampered"" when I compare our differences. I feel bad, because I don't mean to, but some petty part of mine still thinks that. I'd never tell it to their face that ""they can't feel this way because they had it easier"" because I don't think that! But sometimes some petty part of me awakes and makes me think that and then I just feel horrible about this right after."
Dead666Dash_1c3py0a,"Hi! So, I was a university student, so ofc after classes I'd work at McDonalds to get a little bit of extra money. Started the job last year in May, and since I got my degree last month, I decided that I've had enough of working in Gastro, so end march I gave in my 4 weeks notice.


In my notice, I asked our manager to give me a written confirmation that she received the notice (just in case). Fast forward, it's now the 2nd week of Apeil and I just now received her confirmation. My problem is; in the confirmation, she wrote basically ""remember to use up your Urlaub so it doesn't get wasted"". I completely didn't think of that (it was my first Minijob and tbh because of how little I worked I completely forgot about Urlaub).


So, my question is: Did I just waste 26 days of paid leave? Should I quickly last-minute try to have her put in soke of the days? I do work til 31st of April, after all. But even if she did put in some Urlaub, wouldn't it collide with the monthly Minijob limit?

Dead666Dash_13o2s0u,"Hi, the title pretty much spoils it all.


I've been roleplaying since 2015 with Google+ being my first place to do so, so I'd say that I've gathered some experience after the years.


Personally, I don't do much OC roleplays as I only have a few OCs that I never got to work on in depth, and I never even began to think of my own world building, so I stick to fandoms and to being canon characters. But if you have an(y) OC(s) I'd be more than happy to have them included in our RP! I love seeing others' original characters and seeing how they interact with canon characters/my fandom OCs.


As mentioned before, I'm mostly into fandom-RP (list below), fine with romance (FxM, MxM, FxF, Poly), platonic relationships, (found) family, angst, fluff, action and whatnot. I'm also a fan of many AUs, headcanons, canon-divergences, crossovers etc, so the only limit for the plot would be our imagination.


I'm okay with double-ups and more than one things happening at once. I have no problem with OCxCC and CCxCC, I don't mind OCxOC but bear in mind that I don't have that many OCs. My writing style is semi-lit to sometimes lit (really depends on what's happening in the rp), but I find myself adapting to my RP partner most of the times.


The earlier mentioned list of Fandoms:

- Dishonored
- God of War
- Witcher
- Dragon Age
- Overwatch
- Homestuck
- BioShock
- Far Cry (3)
- Marvel
- JJBA

Dead666Dash_1117eoi,"Around a week ago, a family member sent me some money through PayPal Friends and Family as a early birthday gift. I already used some of the money, and today we had a pretty big fight.

He tends to be petty, and as I know you can't get a refund after sending money with Friends and Family, but he could get his money back by contacting his bank.

Dead666Dash_10sigbd,"So, my ex and I had a pretty messy break-up (me finding out he grabbed minors in a sexual way, I'm 19 and he's 27, I was kinda griomed but that's a different story) and afterwards he was a pain in the ass when it came to giving me my stuff back. So of course I got petty.


I re-poste one of his public posts on Instagram on my Instagram story. I didn't call him any names, I just wrote ""white people wearing dreadlocks... 😬"" Because he cosplayed a black character just to wear a dreadlocks wig and my followers are pretty against that. I admit, petty move of me, but it was a public post of his that I just reposted on a story. His post is still up.


I just received a mail from the police, basically saying how he got me for ""KunstUrhG, Straftat nach dem Kunsturheberrechtsgesetz"". I also got a termin at the police station for the next week.


I'll go there, but what can I say? Is his Anzeige even really relevant and legally strong, or is he just making a fool of himself and the police are just ""doing what they're told for the sake of the protocol""? Would screenshots of the story from the Instagram archive (on the phone? Printed out?) be of any help to me? What can I say?

 
Thankfully my German is good enough that I won't be needing any translator with me, but still. I'm a bit nervous.


Edit: it was a repost of an Instagram post on InstaStories. Instagram literally gives you the option, even encourages people, to repost works.

Dead666Dash_vr4cdj,"I know that there's been lots of questions regarding battle vests at airport security, and that they're easy to just take off and place with other metal objects in the tray. But my issue are my pants.


I traveler abroad with a car, only with the pants that I wore and two extra shirts. My issue is that due to change of plans I'd have to travel back with a plane, and my pants have chains, safety pins, pins etc etc pretty much permanently attached to them. Is airpot security very strict about this kind of stuff? Or would I just set off the metal detector, they'd pat me down and all would be okay?"
Dead666Dash_oyf1vz,"So, I use ear buds to listen to music because I just think headphones are annoying with glasses and a mask.


Normally I wear only one earbud (sometimes left, sometimes right) because I want to hear my surroundings. But sometimes I want to fully drown in music with both earbuds, and here comes my problem.


My right ear is fine, but my left ear is a problem. If I don't put the earbud in just right (perfect angle, not too deep [note: it being not ""deep"" enough makes it easy for the earbud to fall out]) I just don't hear why music. Nothing at all. It's as if my ear just ""turned itself off"" (if I put the earbud in my right ear too deep, it's only a bit quieter, but I still hear the music).


Has anybody ever experienced that, or something similar?"
Dead666Dash_ndkeqp,"I got it as a gift from my grandma, so I don't know what model it is (tried Googling, didn't find the exact one) but I know for sure it's from Blaupunkt.


The Volume knob is in the middle, and when I try to turn the volume up or down it switches the tracks (- previous track and + next track) which is annoying. Sometimes when I turn the knob faster or slower it works as its supposed to.

My therapist has a rule, that if you don't cancel the appointment at least 24 hours prior to it, you'll have to pay because you wasted his time. I have the appointment for tomorrow 1 pm.

This one guy keeps on talking with me, which at first was a nice thing, because I work there maybe 4 weeks, and don't know anybody there, so such small talks were nice. (He's not the only one talking with me btw).


Last week, however, he asked if I have a boyfriend, to which I answered ""yes"". He then asked me if I'm married (apparently I look old enough to be married?) So I answered with ""No, I'm 17, I'm too young for marriage"". Putting emphasis on my age, because the guy looks 25-30 years old. He apologised and just kept up the smalltalk (why do you work here, since when and so on). This seemed fine for me.


Today I sat in the break room with him. Alone. I thought that it was okay. He asked me a one of those ""would you travel to X"" questions to keep some conversation going. He then asked me if I'd like to go out with him to [some bigger city, around 40 kms from my home], to which I just made up a lie that I have too much commissions to do and that I don't have time to meet up. He insisted tho.


He just kept on talking how ""he likes me"" how ""he thinks I'm special"" how he ""definitely doesn't love me and just wants to be good friends"". When I sat on my phone in the break room I noticed how from timw to time he was just starring at me and smiling.


You see I was eating a sandwich and I used my phone to text friends, so when he asked for my number I totally panicked, couldn't find any excuse, and just gave it to him. He called me so I could have his phone number too. I decided that if he calls I can just... ignore it, say i was sleeping or working.


But today I arrived home with my boyfriend and an unknown number called me, which I ignored. I'm kinda scared.


I don't want to be mean or just accusing people, but I just feel so... unsafe. And whenever we talked today I just gave the ""I'm not interested"" signs, when asked I mostly answered with something related to my boyfriend, tried everything while still trying to not be rude. He just... keeps on pushing. And he's so much older than me... And I'm afraid of going home after work because we take the same bus and it's always almost empty.

Dead666Dash_fr9pq3,"I know it's really nothing, but it still makes me sad, especially now.


I (16 y.o) always played videogames with my older (23 y.o) brother. We played on PSP(s), PS3, XBox 360 and PS4 locally whenever we could. Rayman, Borderlands, LEGO, Dj Max, Overcooked... Whatever had co-op mode.

When we didnt play we mostly just sat together and watched how the other one plays Brutal Legend, Mass Effect or something. Younger brother (13 y.o) is also interested in videogames, he watched us play, sometimes played with us and so on.


Since almost 5 years my family lives in Germany, older brother stayed in Poland (he found perfect university for him there), we see each lither once/twice a year, and when we do so, we don't really have too much time for videogames because of family reunion stuff. But we're still having fun together.


Whenever I ask my little bro if he wants to play something he just tells me that he's busy playing with his friends or that he's too tired or something. Which is fine, but he could at least do something with me at the weekends. We played together maybe 2 times in those 5 years. It's fine tho, because sometimes he listens to my game recommendations and plays them, and already that makes me happy.


Yesterday he went to me, saying that he was bored af (because of lockdown, it's our 2nd week with no school or many social interactions). I saw this as an opportunity for us to play, so I asked him if he wanted to play something together. He immediately said ""I think I'll try this Mass Effect Andromeda game you gave me, you know"" and just left.


It just makes me really, really sad. I miss sitting on couch with somebody and screaming over something dumb as LEGO Anakin being too dumb to use his power on something. I know you can play most games online but it's... Not the same thing."

2) i'm sorry if this subreddit isn't a place for this, but I really need help, and my German isn't good enough for legal talk in said language


Vonovia is Germany's largest residential property company. Since 2015 I'm living with my family in Germany (2 siblings and parents (I'm 16), in some of the events was also my (now deceased) dog present). Around 2017 we moved to a slightly bigger apartment, it has pretty normal price and is on ground floor, which back then was great, because our dog was 14 years old and couldn't.go up too many stairs.

The apartment was poorly renovated. Electrical outlets - misplaced, paint - uneven, hole for cooker hood - glued shut, wires for many lights - misplaced and tightly tucked into wall's concrete, and many more problems.

After many letters and calls they never fixed the issues.

The real problem started last year in summer, my father stayed home and we left for holidays. When we were gone, our apartment got overflown with water coming from the shower (the part where normaly dirty water goes, hole in the floor, I forgot the name). My father called Vonovia (who arrived 3 hours later, even though it was an emergency and they are in city next to ours) but the whole 3 hours he had to fight to get the water out of our apartment and to inform our neighbors that the basement is also overflown with dirty water.
Which was hard for him, because his German isn't the best in the world.

The wooden floor soaked in all the dirty water and bacteria with it, so 2 maybe 3 months later they ripped it off 'til the base concrete. We had to walk a month or two on cold, dirty concrete, which wasn't even, so we tripped a lot.

However, 4 or five months after the first ""accifent"", it happened again. We woke up to 15 centimeters of water in our place. We were asleep, and our dog was normally sleeping on his place outside of our bedrooms, so god-knows-how-long he laid in the dirty water. Our whole apartment was bacteria'd. As it turns out (which it was back then confirmed) the overflow wasn't our fault. It was because some pipe's filter wasn't fully recovered, so whenever they cleaned the pipes, they never really fixed the issue at it's core.

You see, Vonovia calls special company to CLEAN the pipes, but it's Vonovia's job to pay somebody to fix the issue. They, even though we always tell them what's the issue, decide to ignore it, and even tell us that it's our fault, which clearly isn't.

The whole march we had to live in a uncomfortably-small hotel room, because they renovated our apartment. It was whole month, and they told us to still pay for water, heating and living in it, even though the workers turned all heaters on full power and used the electricity for the power tools. We still had to pay, even though we weren't allowed to be there.

Last week the overflowing happened again, but it was on school day, so I was able to inform my mom before it got too bad. She called Vonovia at 7 am, and told me to go to school. I returned 1:30 pm, and Vonovia just got there. It counts as an emergency, yet they needed 7 hours to get here from city next to us. The whole time, my mother (who doesn't work due to health problems) had to run with towels and buckets to stop water from getting out of the bathroom. Around 2 pm they ""fixed"" the pipe.

Yesterday evening we were hearing bubbling-noises from our kitchen sink. Today, while I was in school, it started overflowing again. 3 hours ago we called them, they're still not here.

We have proofs from many plumbers that we're not the problem. That the cause is poor/old/bad pipe-filter and neighbors (it's too far away from our toilet to be us) who throw not-toilet-friendly things into their toilets. We also know that the issue is our neighbor, who makes for her kids fro dinner nothing but deep-fried fries, and because ""old oil is unhealhy"" she throws it into the toilet almost everyday, and the oil isn't helping the situation.

We showed it Vonovia many times, we told them many times to fix this issue. They still don't do nothing. We don't know anymore what to do. In our city every free apartment is Vonovia's, and we can't move out of the city, because I'm in the last year of my school and I'm attempting many therapy sessions, and moving would make it all even worse, and we also have an aunt + cousin here, who we help/who help us whenever we can."

Hi, I'm 15 years old and I live in Germany. I used Torrents to download ""Deadpool 2"", ""Love, Simon"" and ""Ready Player One"" a month ago (without any VPN) and today we got a letter, that Warner Bros and 20th Fox Century charged me for over 3000 Euro. I read, that signing this and sending it back is the worst thing to do. Should we (me and my parents, that are super angry right now) send back a letter, saying that ""we do NOT agree with their allegations and we did not break the law, but we still agree to never do what they allege we have done, and we'll not be paying their request for payment""? I heard after this you're not supposed to answer their letters anymore, but is this a good idea? I don't want to end up in jail for not answering those letters.

It felt incredibly intense, and almost relieving. I have been trying to make myself squirt for months, but whenever I get close, I feel like I’m going to pee, so I pull back.

It was boxy, it was maddeningly slow, and it was kept in a communal space so that my parents could supervise the one hour that I was allotted each night to use it. They drilled it into me that I should never use the internet to talk to strangers. I think they would have been pretty disappointed to learn that when I grew up, I would come here in an attempt to do exactly that!

I’m a 27 year old woman from Melbourne, Australia, who’s looking to make a friend from somewhere across the globe—specifically, a friend who doesn’t mind that I’m a chronic over-sharer (because they are, too), and who won’t ghost me if or when the novelty wears off.

A little bit about me: I work full-time, and I am also studying part-time to complete my Bachelor of Criminology/Bachelor of Psychology; I love to travel, but don’t get to do it often enough; I watch way too many true crime documentaries, and my absolute favourite TV show of all time is *Criminal Minds*; my favourite author is Stephen King; I have a little bit of a potty mouth; I’m a huge genealogy nerd; I love animals more than I love most people (especially dogs); and I firmly believe that you can get to know a person simply by learning what kind of music they enjoy (for example, the last three songs that I listened to were *In Bloom* by Nirvana, *Juicy* by Doja Cat, and *Running Up That Hill (A Deal With God)* by Kate Bush, which I think demonstrates that I have a dynamic personality, and am a little bit off-beat).

I really don’t mind if you have totally different interests and hobbies than I do, so long as we share similar values. I’m looking to connect with somebody friendly, genuine, and it doesn’t hurt if you’re a little bit weird.

I was sitting on the floor next to my female supervisor and my female colleague, all of us sweating as we sorted and filed and threw away junk, when I looked up and saw that the only two men who work in my team were sitting at their desks, laughing and chatting and not lifting a finger to contribute.

Then comes the time for afternoon tea, and I see that only the women have brought food with them, and I realise that it’s *always* the women who bring food with them when we do potluck-style meals—I can’t remember a single occasion where any of the men have contributed food.

It’s disappointing because I thought that I worked in a pretty progressive environment but the misogyny still manages to creep in in insidious ways.

LIKES_ROCKY_IV_ul11sk,"I’ve been researching my ancestry for quite some time and there is one particular ancestor (my great-great-grandmother) that I feel a great deal of kinship with and compassion for. She suffered a lot of injustices from people who were supposed to care for her (from my research, it seems as if her husband somehow had her institutionalised so that he could have their marriage annulled and he could marry his mistress without facing ostracism from his peers; he lived out the rest of his life with her, whilst my 2gg was locked away for almost two decades before she died alone, not even knowing that one of her children had died only a few months before).

I think that because I’ve dug so much into her life, she feels like a fully realised person to me, not just a story or an interesting footnote, and I genuinely care about her even though I never met her—this is a person who was born 143 years ago, and died in 1948, a full 46 years before I was conceived.

Has anybody else experienced this kind of attachment? How the hell do you process it? I feel like the right answer is to just keep digging and tell her story, and to embrace the freedoms that I take for granted but she never got, but sometimes it’s difficult not to just sit and cry for her and I don’t know if that’s normal or not."

LIKES_ROCKY_IV_u7tgxx,"I’ve been researching my family history since 2012, but have been predominately focussed on my maternal lineage. Recently, I started looking into my father’s side of the family, and I’ve hit a brick wall that I don’t have the cultural competence to get past. I’m hoping that somebody in this community can provide some guidance.

I believe my 3rd great-grandfather, Isidore “Dutchy” Perlstein, arrived in Melbourne, Australia on the SS Northumberland in 1870 (at least according to his application for naturalisation as an Australian citizen (available [here](https://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/SearchNRetrieve/Interface/ViewImage.aspx?B=7771941) on the National Archives of Australia website); I can’t find any passenger manifests to corroborate this). I’ve established that Isidore Perlstein almost certainly wasn’t his birth name; I don’t know his original first name, but his surname was probably Lesczinski, he was born around 1855 in Ozorków, Lodzkie, Poland (Russia at the time), and he was probably Jewish (possibly Ashkenazi).

I’ve done some reading about the Partitions of Poland, the Pale of Settlement and the Russian Empire’s annexation of Poland, and I know that Isidore probably faced incredible persecution and discrimination, but I suppose I’m trying to understand exactly what life was like for him and what drove him to immigrate. I would also love to know why he chose the name that he did, and learn some more about his journey to Australia. I apologise if anything I’ve written here is insensitive—it was not my intention. I’m just trying to learn.

Can anybody provide some context or point me in the right direction?"
LIKES_ROCKY_IV_u5t6b7,"One thing that’s really blowing my mind as I’m building my family tree is how many tiny little things had to happen throughout history in order for me to even exist.

I was born and live in Australia. My maternal 5th-great-grandfather was Joseph Hatton (1748-1828). In 1784, Joseph, an Englishman, was found guilty of grand larceny after breaking into a shop and stealing a quantity of printed cotton, handkerchiefs and ribbons, and he was sentenced to be transported to America for the term of seven years—however, America had won its independence from England the year before, and they refused to take any more convicts, so he was instead sent to the new colony of New South Wales.

If America had accepted Joseph, he never would have met his wife, and they never would have had the children that eventually led to me. Or maybe he would have met a different wife, and I would be an American wondering what my life would be like if he had been sent to Australia. If you want to go further back than that, maybe if he’d never gotten caught, I would have been born in England. Or maybe I would never have existed. I’m here because of a few lousy pieces of fabric.

On my paternal side, my grandfather, his parents and his siblings immigrated to Australia in 1955. He came from Oss in the Netherlands, where my family had lived for hundreds of years. If he’d never come here, he never would have met my grandmother. She never would have given birth to my father, and I wouldn’t exist. Maybe he would have married a nice Dutch girl, and I would have grown up in Holland. But because he got on a boat and made the voyage to a new country, I’m here.

It goes deeper than that. I recently discovered that my 3rd-great-grandfather was an Ashkenazi Jew who was born in Ozorków, Lodzke, Poland. When he was a boy, his hometown was annexed under the Russian Empire, and in the late 1800s, his family fled to Australia and he changed his name from Leszczynski to Perlstein. He originally wanted to go to America, but decided at the very last minute to come to Australia instead. And it’s because of that snap decision that I exist today.

It’s nuts to think that every choice made by these people who lived hundreds of years ago has influenced my life today. If Joseph Hatton had gotten up that morning and decided he wasn’t going to rob a store, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. I might not have ended up being a person at all. It’s kind of sending me into an existential panic, but it’s also pretty humbling and awe-inspiring to think about."

I’m currently watching the “True Lies Part 1-2: The Happy Face Killer” episode of *Catching Killers*, a new docuseries on Netflix and I am so frustrated at the utter ineptitude of the police, and particularly Jim McIntyre.

It particularly frustrated me when he says that he blames Pasternak for the seven murders that occurred after she and Sosnowski were imprisoned. It wasn’t her fault, but one could argue that it was McIntyre’s fault for being more interested in closing the case than actually finding the real killer.

DWIGHT’S office chair has been replaced with a replica of the Iron Throne. He is sitting on it with his hands folded on the desk in front of him. He looks at the camera and smirks.

DWIGHT: Now that Phillip is seven, he’s old enough to supervise the other children, so I’ve had some extra leisure time. And I’ve been using it to rewatch the superb Home Box Office series, *Game of Thrones*. [pauses, frowns] But last night I sat down with a chalice of beet vodka and a plate of cabbage pie, and I finally watched the last season. And let me tell you, I was not impressed. I mean, the mighty Night King taken out by a little girl? *Ridiculous*. I’ll tell you what I would do. I’d befriend the Night King. I’d gain his trust. And then I’d kill him and usurp his power. [mockingly] Oh, who’s that? It’s my best friend Dwight. Wait, *oh no*, don’t stab me with that Valyrian steel! [smugly] And now I’m the King of Westeros, and you’re dead, idiot."
LIKES_ROCKY_IV_g1ugwk,"Covering your face usually draws attention but in this time of crisis it’s unusual not to be wearing a face mask. Many people are also wearing latex gloves when they leave the house, which gets rid of the chance of leaving those pesky fingerprints. Your risk of being identified is greatly reduced.

Note that I am not a thief, this just came to me as CCTV stills have been posted in my building after somebody broke in to the parking garage wearing a face mask as a disguise."

LIKES_ROCKY_IV_fthlb8,I was watching a documentary on YouTube that showed a Caucasian male meeting with a previously uncontacted tribe in Papua New Guinea. They spent three days together and before he left they sang him a song. They had even developed a rudimentary method of verbal communication and told him they would have played their drums but another tribe stole them. It got me thinking - how is it that a population who had never experienced the outside world developed a passion for something so prevalent in other cultures? Is there any instances of certain cultures where music *isn’t* enjoyed or valued?

LIKES_ROCKY_IV_ff6tkw,"I don’t know why I keep opening up to my mother when she has proven time and again that I cannot trust her.

My mother is abusive in the most insidious way: she is emotionally incestuous. I have been told that I should be grateful for how caring she is because from the outside that’s what it looks like. But those people don’t see her bringing up painful memories of an abusive father because she is more concerned about painting herself as a victim and a hero than triggering her daughter. Those people don’t see her confiding in 12 year old me that my father raped her (a claim she has since retracted) or getting a restraining order against him so that she didn’t have to share us with him. Those people don’t see her threatening to report my boyfriend to the police for statutory rape when I ran away from home at 15 or her smashing my phone and slapping me across the face when she found out I texted him complaining about her.

Those people don’t see her neglecting us as teenagers by allowing us to stay home from school whenever we wanted and eat as much junk food as we could afford. Isn’t that the dream? But it wasn’t really about giving us what we wanted. It was about allowing us to develop destructive habits that still negatively impact my life today if it meant that we would like her more, which made her feel better about herself.

Those people don’t see her turning every conversation into a soliloquy about how much of a martyr she is. I keep calling her thinking she’ll comfort me or give me advice when I confide in her about an issue I’m facing and every time I’m surprised when she says “yes, you’re like me in that way” or “I’m stressed too and here’s why”. And then after I hang up she’ll call me back expecting me to assure her that I’m not offended by something she said, or, ironically, upset with her because she’s being too overbearing.

I am so frustrated with myself because I called her again today expecting something different but it’s always the same thing with her. I only see my psychologist once a fortnight and I feel like I don’t have anybody else I can talk to about how I’m feeling - I have a lot of shame and self-hatred and it’s incredibly difficult for me to open up and ask for help. But I’m so stressed. I’m flat broke and my rent is overdue, my electricity bill needed to be paid 11 days ago, I can’t afford to buy my textbooks even though university break ends today and I need to figure out a way to get to campus tomorrow through Wednesday without being able to put money on my bus pass because I can’t afford a car and don’t have a licence. I don’t know if I’ll be able to afford my mood stabilisers next week. My mental health issues make it impossible for me to work and study at the same time so I’m stuck on this disability pension for at least the next two years. I’m worried that I won’t be able to keep up with my studies because I have a tendency to run away when I’m faced with feeling anxious or overwhelmed, which is almost constantly. And I don’t have anybody to talk to about this so I feel like a soda bottle that’s been shaken up and is about to explode.

I’m just so disappointed because I keep expecting more from her than she can offer me. I need her to be a parent and for her not to see me as a faucet that she can turn on when she needs a steady stream of reassurance that she’s a good person."
LIKES_ROCKY_IV_fc7znl,"I don’t really know where to start so I’m just going to jump right in. Last night I had dinner with my dad and something very unexpected happened.

He apologised.

He apologised for the emotional and physical abuse. He apologised for letting my sister and I find him when we were 12 after he tried to commit suicide. He apologised for not divorcing my mum sooner and instead letting things fester until they had an acrimonious divorce that ended in a restraining order and a cross-country move. He apologised for being absent when I ran away from my mum’s home and moved back to our home state. He apologised for not protecting me from his abusive wife when he promised he would. He apologised for choosing her over me.

He said all these things are his biggest regrets and he thinks about them everyday. He said he wishes I would contact him more but he understands if I need space to recover from everything he’s put me through. He’s given me half-assed apologies before but this is the first time he’s taken full responsibility for his actions and acknowledged the damage that he’s done.

I’m so conflicted. Every time I look at him I get triggered. I don’t have any happy memories of my childhood involving him because I’ve blocked most of it out. Things are so raw right now and I just don’t know how to feel."
LIKES_ROCKY_IV_f4q5ye,"So tonight as I often do I was browsing Netflix for true crime documentaries when I came across the series *Serial Killer with Piers Morgan*. I can’t stand Piers Morgan—he has said a lot of problematic things in the past and frankly I find him morally repugnant as a human being. But he is an investigative journalist so I decided to give the series a chance.

I got about 15 minutes into the first episode before I gave up and turned it off. I looked up reviews for it on Rotten Tomatoes and read the following:

>In Serial Killer With Piers Morgan... we get to witness an unrestrained narcissist with a shallow charm and a vastly over-inflated sense of self-importance address his mirror image.

I thought this was accurate. As much as I find what these people did utterly repulsive, I believe that in order to get to the truth of the matter, an effective interviewer must foster an environment that the subject of the interview feels is free of judgment. These people have used mental gymnastics to minimise the severity of what they did in their own minds and when that idea is challenged they can quickly become defensive. Morgan has abysmal interrogation skills and within the first 15 seconds of the interview tries in vain to establish a connection to the first serial killer by confronting him with images of his victims while he describes their murders as ‘brutal’ and heavily quotes the special agent who built a case against him (who the guy clearly can’t stand). He basically ensures that the interviewee is going to be uncooperative and hostile for the remainder of the interview. He is more focussed on giving himself the moral high ground and making himself look like a hero than giving these people a chance to speak. It’s one of the worst documentaries I’ve seen in years.

Have any of you watched this series? What did you think?"
LIKES_ROCKY_IV_f3vuee,"Michael has finally finished writing *Somehow I Manage*. Nobody will touch it with a ten foot pole because it’s basically unreadable so he decides to self-publish and is thrilled to find that it sells over 100 copies. He reintroduces himself to the camera crew as acclaimed author Michael Gary Scott and walks around downtown Scranton wearing a trench coat, a baseball cap and sunglasses because he’s worried he’ll get recognised and mobbed by fans. When people stare at him, he makes a fuss about how he’s a human being and he just wants to be left alone before reluctantly signing autographs for confused bystanders.

Dwight and Angela have a handful of blonde-haired Children of the Corn with widely set eyes and beet-stained teeth. Dwight still works as Regional Manager of Dunder Mifflin Scranton and Angela still heads up accounting, but they also run Schrute Farms with the help of their kids, who Dwight considers old enough to work.

LIKES_ROCKY_IV_ex6xwb,"So every Saturday night, I visit my aunt and uncle for dinner and a movie. One of my favourite things about visiting is seeing their dogs. They have three dogs: a pug named Silas, a groodle named Layla and a golden retriever named Doug. They’ve had Silas for 17 years, whereas Layla is 7 and Doug is 4, so obviously they’re a lot more energetic. Layla and Doug tend to jump on me as soon as I enter the house, whereas Silas just kind of paces the room. In the last year or so, he’s developed a degenerative nerve disorder. You can no longer pet him because if you touch his spine, he’ll collapse. He’s not in a good way. He’s incontinent and almost blind. Sometimes he falls over and can’t get up. Other times he walks into things and gets his head stuck in them. He looks like a little old man and behaves like one too.

So tonight I arrive and I say hello to all the dogs. Silas, Layla and Doug are all standing in the doorway. Silas is just wandering around, minding his own business, while Layla and Doug are running around because they’re excited to see the lady who comes around once a week to give them cuddles and pats and treats. I don’t hear Silas’s paws click-clacking against the hardwood floors when he walks around the room like I usually do but I don’t think much of it. It’s only around dinner time that I make an offhand comment about not having seen him since I arrived.

It’s then that my uncle tells me they had him put down last week.

I know I’m not crazy. I know what I saw. That dog was there to greet me. I think he just wanted to say hello one more time before he went to heaven."

She kicked me out five years ago because I wouldn’t give her a concrete answer on my plans for Christmas Day, not long after she kicked my sister out for refusing to mop the floors after a ten-hour work day. This is the same sister she nicknamed Cindy (as in Cinderella, for obvious reasons).

Fast forward to this year, and my mental health has declined significantly. My partner has been caring for me for almost two and a half years, and three weeks ago, he finally cracked under the pressure after I ended up in the psych ward as a result of an overdose (suicide attempt). He told me it’s over, and we’re never getting back together. Nine years down the drain. And I have nowhere to go but back to my family home.

My father warned her before I came that she needed to be gentle with me because I was going through a rough patch. And she agreed. But last night, what started out as an argument over me eating a chocolate bar (I’m too fat for it, apparently) ended in her screaming that I’ve turned her life upside down and that she doesn’t want me in her house anymore.

Today, she’s been telling him that she can’t handle me being here and I should just ‘get over it’ already. She wants me gone. I’m cramping her style, basically.

Fast forward to 2020, I get into New Age spirituality. I go down a bit of a rabbit hole in new age and then eventually in 2022-2023 I discover bits and pieces of Hinduism and Buddhism. 
The end of 2023 until now I have discovered Christianity. 
I learned in Christianity that you cannot worship false Gods and idols as well as other teachings I’ve been on the fence about (beliefs I’ve always had and grew up with). 
I’m also 23 years old if being “young” has to do with anything. 

I guess my question is, does anyone have similar experience? Not really knowing what to believe or what is considered the “right” way? Or what has helped you figure it out?"

So about 2 months ago, maybe longer, I went to a gas station near my house. I went inside to pay for my gas, and used Apple Pay. I had to physically tap my phone, not a card. 

Anyway, there was a man who purchased beer in front of me. I get to the register and I ask the man to put $20 on a pump. The card reader showed it was ready so I tapped my phone. I hadn’t received a notification yet that I had spent money so when he asked me to do it again, I thought it just didn’t go through. 

I pump my gas and leave. Then I check my phone next time I get out. I’ve been charged twice. One for 21.98 and one for 20.00. Obviously the second one is my purchase. I called the store and explained that I think I got charge for the man in front of me. The man I got on the phone was the one who rung me up. He apparently didn’t want to be wrong. He told me he was the assistant manager and that he couldn’t go back and look at the transactions. I told him that was total bs because I was an assistant manager at a restaurant before, and it’s illegal to not have those reports. It has to be in the system for the store to make money. He then tells me it was his friend that bought it and that I was lying. I asked him if he could at least confirm that last 4 digits of the card to make sure I was not charged. He listed off a few numbers that didn’t match my card. But either way Apple had charged me for it so I knew he was lying. Went up to the store the next day and the guy said he already heard the story and they saw me pay with a card. Which isn’t possible, because I tapped my phone. None of their story added up. 

Today, about 2 months later, I walked in and went to the bathroom. I took off my shorts and my panties and proceeded to pee and rotate my body in a circle. Pivoted on 1 foot. When I walked out of the bathroom, my shoes were very slippery. I was slipping on the floors. I couldn’t hide that there was piss all over this bathroom. So I make my way up to the front and I look at the man and I tell him, “hey it’s like really wet in this bathroom for some reason” and walk out the door.

cjfell777__1dgxtpq,"This is Roxy with the only pinkie I got to meet. Over the last few days I’ve been seeing blood spots on the white paper in their cage. I didn’t know what it was, I was thinking maybe she was in labor. 

I believe now she has eaten her entire litter. I got a call from my boyfriend at work today, he told me he found the pinkies. There were 2, but one was already gone. I explained to him that sometimes mother mice will eat their young if they don’t think there healthy. I told him to remove the pinkie that didn’t make it and to make sure the other one was ok. 

When I got home, he had not removed the pinkie, he didn’t have the heart. I don’t blame him. I had to do it myself. I then put some more toilet paper in the cage for Roxy to nest with. I left her alone after that, because I read online that if you watch them it will stress mother mice out. 

I went back to check about 15 minutes later. The same had happened. The pinkie was gone. And blood on the paper. I realize now, that maybe all those times I saw blood, she could’ve been eating her babies. I’m absolutely devastated. I wish I had known how to prevent it. I had been giving her eggs, unflavored Pedialyte, I did every I knew to. And none of the babies made it. I’m hoping it’s because it was her first litter, apparently first time mother mice may not have motherly instincts. That’s what I read about it.

I wanted to know if maybe he was just caught in the moment, or if he really did intend to hurt me.

The comment I received was along the lines of, “if you had done that instead would you feel guilty? Would you apologize?” 

If the answer is yes, they intended to hurt you. If you never got an apology, they intended to hurt you. If they got mad when you expressed it made you uncomfortable, they intended to hurt you. If you said no and they still did it, they definitely intended to hurt you. 

Just wanted to share because sometimes it’s hard to tell if it’s truly abusive behavior. And a lot of us have very wishful thinking of change, myself included.

Fast forward to now, and I’m in a monogamous relationship that’s been going on for a year and a half now. I’ve had small problems staying committed in the relationship because I felt like I wasn’t getting everything out of it. In the beginning I didn’t even consider him my bf he just kept coming over. Now we live together. He’s had his shortcomings as well, of course, and the relationship has been quite rocky. About 6 months in I realized I wasn’t satisfied. He simply couldn’t be around enough, and omg he doesn’t know how to answer the phone. 

I finally expressed how I’ve been feeling for about a year now. I was scared to tell him because I knew he would never go for something non monogamous. And he didn’t either. He told me he’s fine staying in a monogamous relationship with me, but of course he doesn’t want to find out I’m cheating. And I don’t want to cheat either. But that doesn’t mean I want to stay monogamous. 

He told me it would be impossible to find someone who’s ok with that life style and to give up. Gaslighting I know. But a part of knows it would be hard to find someone near by that has the same views as me. And definitely hard to find two people.

Both of them would regularly use slurs around me yet at the same time tell me don’t say it.

system is in “immaculate” condition. It includes: a Monitor Audio Silver S10 (pair), a Monitor Audio Silver LCR center, a Monitor Audio FB210 Dual sub-woofer, and a pair of Definitive Technology Mythos Gem XL rears with pedestals.

Now I’m tempted by the idea of a full system and I’m tempted by the B&W 600 series floor speakers. But I still think I may just be better off with a pair of bookshelf speakers (I know their not technically bookshelf speakers) that I can connect to wirelessly.

The cassette came off fine but this freehub is just not budging. If anyone has some helpful tricks or advice it would be appreciated. If I just need to buy a separate freehub for the Kickr that will be okay too. I just didn’t want to if I didn’t have to."

I bought one and seated it on my back tire, but I just wanted to know if there’s any advantage to having the wider tire in the back, or if I should just buy a second 700x28? I just didn’t want to if I didn’t have to. 

Also, these tires keep giving me a hard time, and maybe it’s the sealant but they’re not sealing very well and I’ve had to patch the inside of several of them already. Any sealant recommendations or better puncture resistant tubeless tires that are still fast/supple?"

I got a puncture the other day and the sealant seals it up, but only temporarily. As soon as I pump my tire back up to around 50-60 psi the air breaks through the sealant. Is the tire just done? The hole is like 1mm wide, it’s super tiny but it just doesn’t hold. I added a couple more ounces of sealant because all of it came out again this morning but it’s still leaking when I pump it up past 40 psi. 

Any suggestions? I thought about tubeless plugs but was told they are for mtb tires. I bought a new tire that’s on the way but just wanted to see if I could salvage this one."

Bleeding_Hemroid_l5e7zx,"Hey, I’m just trying to figure out my path forward and get the most out of my money. I had purchased a new Apple Series 6 watch for heart rate while riding but it doesn’t connect to Zwift unless I’m using my phone only which I’m not a huge fan of.

I returned the Apple Watch already, because I was really unimpressed with battery life also, but I bought a Garmin heart rate monitor strap and want to know if that’s an alternative long term to a smart watch like the Garmin Fenix 6 or will I find the watch more useful long term?

Which leads me to my final part of this question, which if it is okay to not really have a smart watch, can I use that money towards a power meter without regretting not getting a smart watch in the short term?

This is my first trainer and it seems to be holding up well but every time I go into Zwift Workout mode, my resistance is nothing and I am spinning out in my largest gear. I don’t know if it’s a Saris-Zwift issue and I’ve tried researching it or if there’s a simple fix like something I don’t know about in Zwift. 


The regular rides on Zwift are great and the resistance matches the inclines and declines perfect. I can change the resistance in the actual Saris app on the ERG mode as long as I stay in the app, which doesn’t let me go back into Zwift. I’m hoping I can get some help from you guys cause I was really looking forward to the workout mode.

Like many others, I was let go yesterday from my job and though they’re helping out for a couple weeks, I have a feeling this thing isn’t going away anytime soon so I’m selling a few pairs of shoes that aren’t really in my rotation right now. These are all sized 7 to 8.5 but I’m an 8-8.5 TTS and every single pair of these fit. Tagged pics included. Tag. Tagged tag


[MoMA](https://imgur.com/a/UwMKPFL)
Off-White MoMA - Size 7 (fits 8 and 8.5 pretty snug) Purchased off here on BST and I’ve worn them one time. The guy I purchased from said he wore them 3x and that’s the truth. These things look DS. I’m not sure the seller or factory but I’d assume OWF just from quality. Asking $100 + Shipping.


[MCA](https://imgur.com/a/KpPMstw)
Off-White MCA - Size 7.5 (fits 8.5 perfect, both the Air Forces run easily a whole size up) Purchased off BST and I’ve worn them maybe 3 times. These are a little more worn then the MoMA’s but still very clean and easily 9/10 condition. These are from will and OWF... Definitely quality. Asking $100 + shipping.


[Dunks](https://imgur.com/a/MAhafuI)
Off-White Dunk - Size 8.5 (fit 8.5 TTS) Purchased off of BST some time ago and I wear these a few times. I bought a pair of retail dunks back when prices were ridiculous and I haven’t been able to Un-DS them in hopes of being able to get my money out of them but I just need the cash. Asking $110 + shipping.

SOLD to u/idrissa Travis Scott x Jordan 6 - Size 8 (fits 8 and 8.5 a little snug but still very comfortable) Purchased off of BST when I first found this subreddit and they’re the GET batch, the best batch from what I’ve been told.m, and they really look it. I just can’t style these as hard as I try and I’ve worn them outside one time. Asking $120 + shipping.



[700](https://imgur.com/a/504H7Al)
Hospital Blue Yeezy 700 Hospital Blue - Size 8.5 (fits 8.5 TTS) These were purchased from GMK and I wore them maybe 6-7 times. I did cut the laces shorter so it may be an issue if you have wide feet. I’m asking $50 + shipping.


[“V3”](https://imgur.com/a/WwoVGEp)
Yeezy 350 “V3” - Size 8.5 (fits 8.5 TTS) And I have a pair of “v3’s which were supposed to be Antlia v2’s but I guess got v3’s. They’re brand new but totally a fictional shoe, as well as ugly to boot. But they’re comfy and if you don’t care then they’re perfect. $20 + shipping
If you have any questions about the shoes or anything else let me know. I’m willing to hear out prices but don’t lowball me and waste both our times. I would also be willing to do bundle deals."
Bleeding_Hemroid_ehgynv,"$Sold Sold Sold

Selling these H12 Mars Yards I recently purchased. They claim to be 8.5 but they’re very snug and fit much more like an 8.

Not sure on flaws but I believe these are one of the closest 1:1 pairs out there.

Will ship USPS priority anywhere in the US and with a Paypal invoice.

Bleeding_Hemroid_dshcca,"Also looking for a pair of no bad days in 8.5 also, new or used. I have a pair of J1 fearless’s DS 8.5 that I will trade for with cash for either pair. I can’t post WTS links because I think I don’t have enough karma"
Bleeding_Hemroid_cy3apn,Pretty straightforward. Looking to get my girlfriend a pair of OW Vapormax’s and wouldn’t mind some input on who has the best Vapormax’s either. But of course my selfish ass can’t get her a pair of shoes without wanting to get myself a pair also. So was just curious if anyone had any offers on free shipping or discounts on two pairs of shoes? Thanks for any help

Bleeding_Hemroid_cld9en,Selling my project destroyer bot that I recently purchased for $280. I have too much going on with school and I took a leap and bought a bot and it surprosingly works well. I cooked The Semi-Frozen's and Cream Whites today but was gone most of the day and I'm sure could have cooked more. I also got the Parra SB Dunk's from PD and even when all the residential proxies went down today PD and Destroyer Proxies kept working. Selling for cheap because I need gone. The Key is good through 2020 and it's only $60 bucks to renew in January. Will consider offer's or trades because I'm done using bot's for a while.. HMU on here
Bleeding_Hemroid_chvx33,"Does anyone have a good way to explain if I need to buy proxies for project destroyer or if I can run tasks without having proxies? I’m new and just trying to get the hang of project destroyer. Any tutorial will be helpful, I’m just trying to run tasks with a fake credit card to see if I’m doing it right but I have no idea what I’m doing. Anyone have any helpful links or advice for me? I’d really appreciate it."

Bleeding_Hemroid_cf0dqg,"I’m looking to buy my first shoe bot but I’m new as fuck and am just looking for others opinions on what the best options are for an all on one bot, a Nike or adidas bot. Just looking to make a little money on reselling and trying to figure out which way to go. I’m on tidal and BotMart so I feel pretty sure that as long as I go through a middle man I’ll be good. Any advice? I wouldn’t mind one that worked with supreme and footsites either. Thanks for any help"
Bleeding_Hemroid_bzhhlj,Will the price keep dropping for resell? The size 9 I got is too big so if I want an 8.5 should I wait and see if the price goes down further or just buy 8.5’s now?
Bleeding_Hemroid_bgu9yt,"This is my first replica purchase. I just got into shoes and I’ve wanted these since the beginning. I ordered from Tonysneaker.net and Tony walked me through the whole process on whatsapp so I was able to purchase quickly.

Here’s the pics he sent me: https://m.imgur.com/a/35YkLIq

Bleeding_Hemroid_az81g0,I’m just wondering if I am taking a dose of kratom but have some capsules also should I take the capsules 5 or 10 minutes before to let them dissolve or should I just take everything at once?
Bleeding_Hemroid_autsya,"I’m not asking for anyone to write my essay. I’m just looking for some semblance of a guide or outline I can use. I want my thesis to be why the FDA wants to ban kratom, or is kratom more harmful or helpful. Any advice on how I could have that look or articles or examples would be greatly appreciated"
Bleeding_Hemroid_2n0g48,"I'm now 4 days without fapping, but I've had sex a couple of times. I think that means that I'm doing the standard challenge. Another question, are like NSFW subreddits like /r/girlswithglasses considered porn or can I just not watch videos like on nudevista or xvideos? Also, I've noticed an obvious increased sex drive and sorta more energy which is nice."
Bleeding_Hemroid_2mhemg,"I have a massive love affair with whiskey, Bourbon in particular and I'm always romanticizing about whiskey. 

A little background info is I entered a 90 day residential treatment program about four months ago. I had OD'd on a killer combo of methadone, Klonopin and wild turkey. My drinking was out of control and I couldn't go a day without at least a pint. 

Fast forward to now I've been put of treatment for nearly a month, I've tried to make the excuse that I'm the exception by having 'one glass' but I proved that I could not. I blacked out 8 nights ago, got in two fights (I've never been a fighter) and literally passed out in a complete strangers house, uninvited.. Like break into status. 

Anyways, I say all that to say I know I can't drink and I have a lot on the line if I do drink again, but I still am looking for that one loophole. It's infuriating! I go to meetings, groups, have a job and a few hobbies, a gf and a 5 month old son I love more than life itself, but I'm afraid given a night alone with too much time on my hands ill make the wrong decision."
Bleeding_Hemroid_28kh3e,"I live in a town of 40,000 and I sit in a lawyers office drafting documents and answering phone calls. I fucking hate it. Occasionally, I get to ride from law office to law office to drop off prepared papers, which is great because I get to ride. I envy messengers and other employees that spend a majority of their time on their bicycles, but I know of zero in my town. Do any of you have any ideas until I go back to school?"
Bleeding_Hemroid_2109h4,"So I was given two pills and the gal said they were Baclofen. I hadn't heard of Baclofen so I was pretty interested. I did a quick search and found out they caused effects similar to GHB which got me excited as I've never had the opportunity to take GHB either. But after a pill search, turns out they are some other shit called Gabapentin. It doesn't appear to have much/any recreational value.. 

My question is they seem to be somewhat in the same realm of Pharms so should or can I take them? Thanks for any answers and advice."
Bleeding_Hemroid_1whnf1,"I received some qwiso from a buddy for helping him out so I can't complain, but it's really dark in color and I took a dab to try it t and it was pretty harsh and sizzled on the TI.

Difficult_Map_9762_1dg7az0,"Trying to find the right single hooks to swap out for trebles, save me the time of taking the VMC no. 2 to the store. Scoured for a while online but couldn't find an answer, also not sure if single hooks will affect the lures action.

I'm going pike fishing have caught a few in the past but if I get lucky and land a big one then I'm hoping to avoid unnecessary damage to the fish from using trebles. It just looks sketchy having never caught a fish 3'+ and especially a pike, wanted to use single hooks to make things easier on the release?

Thanks"
Difficult_Map_9762_1de5ypu,"For reference, I'm in my early 40's and this girl I used to work with (up until recently) is 26. We grew to be friends at work and I was always able to help her laugh we had a shared interest outside of work so quite a few times we hung out and did that. Also went for a couple hikes, I helped her move she had a hard time finding people to help, offered a lot of moral support she went through a hard breakup, and we'd chat over text messages all the time. Just funny stuff while messaging, poking fun at one another, a really fun relationship.

Over the last couple months, since she's left work, I've not heard much from her. I've had a lot of friends over the years so I'm accustomed to people rather being friends or acquaintances and then people go thier separate ways. Maybe a friend for a season, maybe a few years, a decade, people come and go. But I've never really had a girl-friend that I actually spent time with solo, always guy friends. Not a big deal when guy friends kinda drift off, no words are really said about it, no feelings or emotions. At least not for myself.

Regardless of knowing that the relationship was not exactly sustainable, and yea people come people go, I was pretty bummed out that she wasn't asking me to hang out anymore. She was the one that initially got us hanging out, outside of work, wasn't my idea and making friends at work is not always a good idea, it just bummed me out that I wasn't hearing from her anymore.

About a week ago, messaged her and thanked her for the time that we spent with one another. Let her know that I had a lot of fun and mentioned what I said up above, that I've had lots of friends over the years and it's hard to keep friendships going, beyond texts and such. Not saying that texting friendships are not real ones I'm just old school and it's a different kind of friendship, to actually be in the company of another person as opposed to screen-friends.

I've not heard back. Not sure if that means she's hurt by this or it's a silent recognition. Either way, I had a lot of fun with her just felt the need to send her that message, for personal closure perhaps, I'm just not sure if her feelings are hurt but do not plan to message again and find out.

Was kinda the definition of an odd couple, a guy my age hanging out with a girl her age lol. And yea, seems like the relationship would've come to a close anyways.

Not sure it makes me the the a-hole or whatnot. It wasn't her altogether ghosting me but I do see that a lot of people do that to one another as opposed to being thoughtful and at least having a brief conversation about how it's time to move on. Especially with the ability to use your phone, message someone.

So yea, AITAH? Not even wanting her to be, this was just a new one on me. I've not had an actual girlfriend in years and our friendship really made me see what perhaps I've been missing out on. But then again those come to a close as well, for the most part. "
Difficult_Map_9762_1clj8mb,"By this time it really didn't matter, so my friend and his wife, and myself, just stood in shin-high thirty degree water looking back at the canoe. I did not really wish to go on this adventure, fished this particular lake (from the shore) quite a few times growing up, knew what happens when the wind picks up, but in an effort to not be a party pooper I went along.

There's a post up about freewill, OP suggesting we don't have a choice, our brains just tell us what to do, I could've froze as the third wave entered and near completely filled the canoe as opposed to abandoning ship then immediately swimming to shore, but bail and swim I did. So did I have a choice? Or was it basic (for my brain at least) survival instinct plus years or swimming experience. Truly was a life threatening situation we all had life vests on but were also layered in winter clothes. Perhaps 75 feet or so was the distance to shore but the howling wind and waves made it look a lot further. Body being drug down by all the extra clothes. Life vest seemed to not be working very well, seemed like I was sinking, and I was, but swim-swim-swim....left looking back from the shore at the capsized boat.

I let my friends know that I'm down for another boat ride, but it'll have to be this summer. When I'm only wearing shorts and a tee-shirt as opposed to a personal drowning outfit. And certainly on a safer body of water.

It's just funny, wouldn't do it again, but an experience like that can make you stop and think. After the fact. Plenty of days over the last couple years that I've not wanted to be here anymore. Years past as well, the desire for it to be over, but swam I did. And for whatever reason I was left grinning a little while standing in shin-high freezing water as the waves returned the canoe to us.

So I guess in some situations you don't have a choice, but it certainly helped having grown up on water and thus knowing what to do in a situation like that. So maybe it's a combo. Fun weekend.

Difficult_Map_9762_1bscnvy,"I'm not sure how many are out there, but there's a ton of churches in town. Just drove past a pretty big one and cars were filing out. How do you folks do it? Have faith and believe in the afterlife. But how many out there this Easter Sunday actually do not have faith and believe all of this. So with that said, how many would rather be at home relaxing on this beautiful Spring morning as opposed to trying to find a parking spot plus seating big enough for the entire family.

Trying to stay respectful this Easter morning, because people hold this close to thier hearts and it gives a lot of people hope, that life ....that this all meant something. There's a better place and forever after one's lights go out from this temporary existence. But I guess driving by that church this morning, was already in thought about my days ending and you never know it could happen today, then driving by and wondering how people do it...it's just not true. There's nothing after my expired days.

It's quiet, spare the furnace. I'm housesitting for a friend so just me and silence, spare that sound. These are the moments where you'd think you could find God but there's even less, alas nothing to be found. So this is the only life I get this is not a dress rehearsal, nor is there a post-Easter brunch in my future. Rumor has it that a lot of those brunch-goers are pretty rude, this comes from the waitstaff.

I dunno. But nothing can change my mind about there being something after life. God would have to, and I'm not sure how or why a person would just take someone else's word for it. Or the Bible's. 

But I guess it's admirable and whatnot, that Christians have faith and this all adds value and meaning to life. Kinda jealous in a way. I'll just never be able to believe any of it, and it wasn't for a lack of trying. 

Rant over I suppose. 


"
Difficult_Map_9762_1bm8yhv,"I'm not sure how people manage to believe that there's a personal God, or god. What's hard to wrap my brain around is how there can be one person at a stop light and the man upstairs is smiling down upon them. Then the next car over is a person who's he/it's simultaneously upset with.

Then on the street corner there's a church and God's presence is filling the entire building, but then simultaneously happy or disgruntled with everyone inside as well.

So aside from other reasons, I'm not able to believe there's a personal god for anyone. Far too large of a stretch of the imagination. Truly seems like one's imagination is where God resides.

If anyone here believes in a personal God/god/creator, what are the reasons for that? 

"
Difficult_Map_9762_1bhpn5o,"I guess this would be the Christian version of god, that question, but when someone is at a park or something and looking at nature and they see the beauty in it. Then maybe a swarm of butterflies surrounds them as the sun sets. Praise God

But then someone else at the park kneels down to tie thier shoe and unbeknownst to them there's a ground nest of yellow jackets a few feet away and they swarm the person. And that individual is allergic to yellow jackets so they don't live through the attack.

I'm guessing that a lot of Christians will say that God works through the natural world. But it's not God's fault about the yellow jackets. That's on Adam and Eve. Never really situated as fact 

But (for myself at least) God not getting the credit for the stinging insect kinda goes out the window when it's nature vs. nature. One of the more hard-core examples is the Tarantula Hawk Wasp. It'll hunt down a Tarantula then attempt to subdue it with a paralyzing sting. If successful, the wasp will drag the Tarantula back to its own burrow and lay her egg upon its back. However many days later out pops and larvae and it proceeds to eat the Tarantula, alive.

So yea it doesn't make any sense. On my end. May as well hand it all over to god. And leave out God's ways are higher than our ways, beyond searching out and understanding.
"
Difficult_Map_9762_1bcwj6k,"Maybe it's just an internet thing, and of course there are some pretty grumpy and mean non-believers, how they interact with those who do believe, but there's this verse in the Bible which states that ""that Lords servant must be kind to everyone"".

Granted there have probably been some trolls of sorts, maybe AthiestGuy8675309, and they don't even really care about the topic of non-belief vs. belief their just bored or whatever and looking to push some buttons. And there's probably been a JesusSaves3:16 but their not even a Christian and also just looking to push buttons. And the two have probably met one another but don't realize thier both up to the no good, just going at each other but completely oblivious to the fact that they both have something in common.

Regardless of all that, and I've come across people saying it before, if the Spirit truly resides within someone then the Spirit would want nothing to do with someone who's antagonistic and not kind. Seems more like that person would be performing the will of a certain evil entity, if thier not kind. I'm not one to get on board with the ""we're all human and God understands that we slip up"" because, so far as I'm concerned, and some Christians, if someone is filled by the Spirit then being kind would just ooze out.

I know exactly what to say to someone. I could attempt to save them and bring them to Jesus and also the prospect of a perfect afterlife, one without the pain and suffering that they experience. That there's something better after all of this, this life is just a dress rehearsal perserve until the end your life is but a blink of the eye for what's to come. Even though I don't believe it myself could still be the Lords servant, but I'd not be getting told by God that I was a good and faithful servant, instead I'd be told to depart from me I never knew you. Then get cast into outer darkness.

So it's a weird one. Some Christians say that those who argue against God are performing the will of you know who. Oh yea watch this....poof! Just saved someone and maybe that act really turned someone around. And then the Spirit resided within them and they were kind to everyone. Meanwhile, I'm headed to the lake of fire.

Funny stuff to think about. Mostly just rambling but tldr: the title of my post"
Difficult_Map_9762_1b5f6z4,"This just made me chuckle to myself, when the director/producer of the show The Chosen said that ""God gave me The Chosen"". His name is Dallas something or other and he was being interviewed by another man of God on that guy's YouTube channel.

The comment about God giving that guy The Chosen came during the section of the video where he was responding to criticism of the show. Like, what a way to try and shut up his fellow Christian critics, because it was given to him by God.

I still peek in here and there, maybe there's a God even though my brain tells me there's not. Then I come across a bunch of funny lies and what appears to be another con man. Or that guy really believes that God hooked him up. But if God did, then wouldn't God basically be the one directing the show? Too funny"
Difficult_Map_9762_1azmx3o,"I've come to appreciate the giant mess that is Christianity, kinda. After clicking on enough Christian YouTube videos over the last couple years the algorithm sends me all kinds of stuff and it's honestly pretty crazy how much is out there, the variety, but also how you can get one message here then watch a different video and it's a different message. Fun times, more like funny and discombobulated.

He doesn't care about any of this, my cat. It's warm enough outside this morning to where it was OK to release him into the dark of a pre-dawn morning. In a flash, he disappears into the wind and I'm left standing alone with the wind chimes and left over rustling leaves of this fading winter. There are moments in life that I wish I could bottle and save, times where nothing matters and I'm alone with....the wind and unseasonably warm weather, I guess. Special, unexpected moments. And sometimes, in these moments, I still wonder if there's something out there. Apparently all I'd have to do is go back inside plop back down on my bed and pull out the Bible that's not been read in over a year. If I want to hear from God. But you can only read the same thing over and over until it's just....reading the same thing over and over a again. Not to mention that what I think I'm reading, what it appears to mean, interpretations, does not mean the same thing to the person down the block from me.

Jars Of Clay. The popular Christian band from back in the 90's. Came across a video this morning from some content creator who has over 300k subscribers and he's saying that that band is evil, and they're making a comeback. Something about deceiving people, that band, obviously making money off of God, I'm guessing a lot back in the 90's....good for them? But jars of clay....the potter does what he wants with the clay....he hardened pharohs heart and can override freewill....""no he can't!"" God does not and will not override freewill.....

Wondering what my cat is up to. Probably hiding in the shrubs as the wind blows and swirls around. Cares not about any of this, is not aware of any of this, just waiting for a mouse. What a lucky guy.







"
Difficult_Map_9762_1alw3bh,"I'm not a believer of God, rather it be Catholic or protestant or Muslim, so on, but I spent a lot of time looking into religion and faith. Read the Bible front to back and then some, and probably spent too many hours listening to and reading over debates.

22 Flee the evil desires of youth and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart. 23 Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 24 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 25 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

I don't get how anyone who claims to know God can overlook verses like these, continue engaging in conversations and going after one another, inside and outside of belief. Furthermore, if someone believes that God knows everything and is everywhere at all times then how exactly would he not know what people are discussing online? 

So what's the rationale? How does a believer of God feel ok or justified in being sarcastic or rude or harsh with a non-believer? Or just butting heads, like a protestant vs. a Catholic. Because the Bible, these verses, says to be kind to everyone. Not just who you want to be kind to.

Doesn't bother me, personally. It's honestly kinda funny to watch the show unfold. Just saying, as a fly on the wall."
Difficult_Map_9762_19f9ue3,"I'm not a Christian so take all of this with a grain of salt, but I went in then out of belief in a very short amount of time. Just felt like dropping all of this off today.

What brought me into belief was something which occurred a few years ago. Prior to this ""spiritual experience"" that I had while laying on my bed I was coming out of, I guess, a dark night of the soul and at least a month long crap adventure of searching my thoughts for truth - what's after life why are we here, but never a thought of God on any creator.

As the pain and struggle lifted over the course of a few days it just up and happened - god was there with me. Let my friend know what was going on throughout that experience she's a Christian so of course she urged me to repent and accept Jesus. Reluctantly did, didn't feel right or genuine, but I said the words.

There was a post I came across on here about how deconstruction is just a buttered up way of becoming an athiest. I did not even know what athiesm was until after ""converting"", I learned about atheism from the internet. So I guess I was pretty much an atheist before my ""experience with God"" but it wasn't that I thought about it that way, I just never thought about God during the decades prior.

I'm not saying that Christianity made me into an Atheist, but Christianity brought me to learning about it. 

Sometimes I'd like to go back to before the internet existed. Living under a rock was not all that bad. And no matter how many ways nor how many verses from the Bible are sent my way, to try and help bring me into faith, nothing has gotten through. And I'm now an atheist. When I didn't even know what an Atheist was, prior to my spiritual experience. Which may in fact have been nothing more than a hallucination/psychosis.

Life is certainly strange. There's a lot of stuff going on out there and a lot of so called truths. But in all honestly my thinking brings me to there's nothing after my days expire. Did not know what nihilism was, prior to my experience. I'm actually not even sure if I'm a nihilist or an atheist. Just a person who's here for a short while then gone again.

Just processing a little this morning, figured I'd share it here. Hope y'all have a good day"
Difficult_Map_9762_198x0gx,"23 Don’t have anything to do with foolish and stupid arguments, because you know they produce quarrels. 24 And the Lord’s servant must not be quarrelsome but must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. 25 Opponents must be gently instructed, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, 26 and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will.

I'm not a Christian but have read the Bible nearly twice plus hours upon hours randomly, NT and OT locations. This does not make me some kind of expert, but there are quite a few places with verses like those of up above. I'm aware of the not a true Christian thing, and also the no true Scotsmans saying, but regardless - internet conversations.

It was a surfacing Blue Whale, a YouTube short, looked like a submarine and what an amazing animal, they truly are. I like to glance at the comments from time to time and someone said something along the lines of ""One of God's beautiful creatures"". Already knew how the replies to that would play out ""herrrre we go again"" you can basically pick any video and somewhere in there you'll find at least one atheist/exchristian going toe-to-toe with a Christian, so eventually one of the Christian replies was ""have fun in hell"".

It's funny. Especially when you pull in verses like that of 2 Timothy, why are you peeps even engaging in this? So I look at verse 26 ""and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will."" and wonder to myself, who's actually doing the will of the devil here? Granted I'm not on board with God's existence, matters not much to me, these conversations, but yes, performing the desires of the enemy does not look to exclude Christians. Seems like everyone is fair game.

It's not just YouTube videos either, most certainly happens on reddit, and most certainly takes place between Christians. What a turn off, to sit back and observe. Everyone gets upset from time to time and quarrels but the internet is different, people go looking for these sorts of conversations. It's not some random thing that happens, it's purposeful. 

But the sun is rising. The clouds are pink and the scenery is almost not real. Some mornings just have a certain look to it, a feel, surreal. I'm not sure if God is real but the mountains look like that of a painting this morning. Quiet, and care not for the crazy of the internet. I guess there's my Skeptic devotional for today."
Difficult_Map_9762_193z9t6,"Reddit is weird, not in a bad way but just how you can change the channel, change subs, and you're magically teleported to a new world. But then you set your phone down and you're back in reality. What to do with all of this information? What did I used to do before all of this information was one click away, before the internet. Was i better off? Mentally. Is it a good thing that I have access to all of these channels, or is it too much information. 

There's a lot to keep track of, if God is real, what he has to keep track of, the millions of social media posts and videos. Like the cat riding it's best friends back as he runs around the yard. The odd couple of domestic short-hair saddling a golden retriever. Then take that video add some others and you have a funny cat video compliantion. God already watched these scenes play out in real-time, now he's watching them again and again and again as people watch them again and again.

Maybe God cannot keep track of all this stuff. Or has watched those videos enough times and doesn't waste time watching them again. Same for all these reddit posts, anything online, articles and news stories. Too much information, too much to keep track of.

It's a very hard thing to get behind (aside from God existing) that he's watching all these videos and reading all these posts while the reader and watcher (the humans) are doing so. And then he's listening to people's prayers, answering prayers, rejoicing over people in gladness but also grieved with tons of other people over thier sins....it's too much to believe. That something is that aware and involved at every moment.

And then to believe that he's in my thoughts as I wrote all of this, knew I'd write it, knows what kind of day I'll have while I do not, not yet at least. Yea it's a lot to get behind, to believe. Then he's holding the world up on invisible strings, not to mention everything else in the universe.

There's a few subs that I have a personal connection with, can highly relate. One of which is filled with people who want life to be over and another is for people with a brain disability, which can also lead to thoughts of wanting life to be over. So if God knows everything then he's watching those conversations play out as well. Already knew they'd play out. Already knows if this and that person will be around tomorrow.

Just bored and woke up early again, sun has not risen yet. It's dark and I'm alone with my thoughts again and stuff like this comes to mind in these situations. Be glad when the day comes to where I'm no longer considering these things. Kind of a waste of time."
Difficult_Map_9762_190qff6,"I'm basically headed for whatever eternal separation of God actually is, rather the lake of fire or just utter nonexistentence. And the reason for that is that I cannot fake the belief of God. And I'm not noticing anything in the Bible where there's a loophole of sorts for those who tried to believe but cannot lie to themselves. And I'll just assume that since God knows everything then he'd know that I'd be lying, should I profess belief.

Spent a lot of time looking into this. Both sides, belief and non-belief. I read the Bible front to back and nearly twice, hundreds of hours all over as well, the opinion that God only ""speaks"" through the Bible was....so much for a God who can do anything, if he only speaks through the Bible.

Obviously reddit is a place to discuss matters, but after a while it came to appear that God is no where to be found on reddit. Almost like God gets set aside so the adults can talk, never once sensed God in conversations. Haven't sensed God anywhere, not in the visible world not at church, not a work or the grocery store, nor in prayer.

Anyways, random post, but I'm hell-bound and cannot lie to myself, convince myself that God exists. Exhausted every avenue and basically just wasted a year of my life searching. Wish me luck, I guess. Maybe predestination is a thing afterall, that's assuming/pretending that God exists. So back to what's visible, the real world of sorts."
Difficult_Map_9762_19037d9,"Yesterday at work I came across two different Bibles, illustrated, both of which had left out chapter 34 of Genesis. Was confused to as why, especially since the Bible says to not add to or subtract from it? Whatever, I guess. Probably for the best."
Difficult_Map_9762_18su99c,"Not sure if that's merely a general statement or something that can be debated, that if I came to believe in God, any god or God, well that belief would add zero value to my life. Life would not be magically enriched and worth carrying on with. In a manner of speaking, carry on with.

It's along the same lines as anything else that has to do with beliefs. Rather you (or I) believe it or you/myself do not. Like my belief of a supreme diety, there is none. Which is the cliche but true saying of ""you don't choose your beliefs"", which I do not. There's nothing there but nothing, zero belief. There's nothing there as far as a creator that loves me, and also if I came to believe it would not add anything to this present life. I'd just have a new belief. Something along those lines.

Without being a jerk, I'd suggest that believing that God enriches one's life is not something that a lot of individuals came to believe themselves. It was ingrained into them until it became a thing. I'm fairly along in my years never attended church growing up so nothing was implanted into my mind. As far as God goes. So how does a person come to the conclusion, later in life, that having a God around makes life more meaningful and tolerable? Looks as if for many people those beliefs get implanted by others, not a living God who laser beams ones brain from the supernatural realm.

It's just something I sat with last week. Asked the question of ""if I came to believe in God, what would that do to and for my life"". What came back was nothing, I'd just have something else on the list. 

I've heard just about every angle, as far as what happens when you bow a knee and submit one's will to God's. These changes that will take place, people have had thier lives turned around and this and that. Which is not a bad thing at all, but I'll also suggest it's placebo in nature. And getting filled by the spirit is some kind of chemical and hormonal process + people implanting into someone else's mind what it's like and feels like. And it's not for everyone, especially those further along in thier years.

That's about it. I'm open for feedback but once more, coming to the belief of God would add no additional value to my life."
Difficult_Map_9762_18p62pp,"I'm still caught up on this one it's been discussed a million times before - the varying interpretations of scriptures. And somehow God is real, even though there's so much in the Bible that people butt heads against, the actual meanings. Not clear cut, many divisions within belief. 

I've been asked ""why I do not believe in God"" and I've watched others get asked this question a bunch of times, I've also been told that my reading comprehension skills need worked on, when offering up what I thought the Bible was saying. Basically because the person who offered up my needing to learn how to read better had a different opinion about verses. 

Upon my first read-through of the Bible, came to the potter and clay parts. How God can do what he wants with the clay who are you to question the potter, thankfully I read the Bible before looking into theology because my brain did not get swayed by the opinions of others. Figured it was the Bible, supposed word of God, just read it and it'll make sense. So what the potter and clay stood out as was just that, God can do whatever and whenever, which brought freewill into the picture. Some say no God does not override, some say yes. 

I guess that I'd just propose that God would be more believable, if people got on the same page about everything. Like salvation, what does it take? Couldn't tell you myself but the Bible looks to state that....yea. One giant mess. 

Others will say to just seek Jesus and look away from the debates, so that seems to mean put down the Bible and just pray? But Christians are called to read the Bible, so that doesn't altogether seem right. Gets to the point with God where it looks to no longer be about God, he gets set on the shelf so the adults can debate over who's right about what they believe. Then the flies on the wall looking on, some of them fly away and want nothing to do with all of this. And of course God doesn't swoop in and clarify. 

So there's one reason why I don't believe in God, or propose that he does not exist, too many divisions. Not a very original topic for debate but it's certainly a highly personal one."
Difficult_Map_9762_18m0epe,"The proposal that God is a person never really situated with myself. Hard enough to fathom a spirit being who created the universe and is just invisibly sitting around and watching everything play out, absolutely everything, but a personal God who's a person, probably will never be able to get on board with that. 

God is sad when people are sad, and also disappointed when they go against his commandments 

God will dance over you with gladness and takes part in your happiness, he's happy when you're happy.

Really doesn't make any sense. Put two people side-by-side and he's upset with one of them and pleased with the other, at the exact same time. Seems more realistic that God is an emotionless and expressionless force and cares not for what's going on down here, the supposed creator of the known universe is not with everyone, is not judging anyone. 

It's stuff like this, pondering over these things, that makes any god from any religion seem made up, anthropomorphic mumbo-jumbo. But that's just on my end, my thoughts."
Difficult_Map_9762_18jrnz1,"From time to time, a morning before work here and there, sitting in the parking lot all alone until it's time to clock in, I'll look out over the scenery and sort of seek God. I no longer believe in God and have ingested hours of debates and sermons via YouTube, and of course read through countless conversations and debates on reddit, varying forums, but every day I end up with my banana and coffee watching the sun rise before work. And there's nothing there. I still reach out once in a while, but there's nothing there. Just is not. 

If God is in fact real, well I feel as if he plays favorites. Leaves some people in the silence to be still and know that he is God? While others get visited by him in one way or another, and quite frequently. The most convincing arguments for God's non-exsistence comes from the ex-devout Christians. Those who used to be preachers and pastors, others being daily Bible readers who were Frontline warriors for Jesus, and so on.

When I read the Bible for the first time, few years ago, what I noticed most was wrath and drama. Not love. Come to Jesus or you'll not get to the father, Jesus will pull families apart, love Jesus more than anything, have no other gods before God, and so on. I'll also suggest that no one should need to go through anyone to know God, need taught about God. No middle man, no confusion over scriptures, and God should at least show up from time to time as you finish your banana and coffee while watching the sun rise. 

It's really hard to try and conjure up something original to post about here, this forum. Pretty sure most everything has been discussed. But yea I guess (IMO) God plays favorites and leaves others in silence to...be taught by man what God is about? Something like that. Silly notion of sorts, the creator of the known universe and life, everything, needs man's help to help other people have a relationship with him, understand him and all that. Just some random thoughts from the peanut gallery."
Difficult_Map_9762_18dn9ic,"Guess this would be for the sweats:

I just learned that you get all the new schematics during the tier 5 dark aether, elder sigil. Which isn't a bad thing but after doing so it's pointless to return? 

So I guess that leaves farming for the level 3 pack a punch schematic and the legendary tool plan from tier 3? Red zone. 

I'm just wondering what the red zone will look like later down the road. Even just four teams in there will be....well yea there's not a lot of contracts to go around. 

Almost like season 1 for zombies is kinda over in a week, if you get through the elder sigil dark aether. Not complaining just a funny update of sorts."
Difficult_Map_9762_18cvwxo,"It's a bit of a bummer that the new dark aether area is not looking to be all that solo-friendly. I'd not mind at all grouping up with others and dropping in, but even orchestrating that is and will be a challenge as well. 

I played a ton of Outbreak and it was set up to have a reduced amount of zombies based off of how many players were on your team. Not sure if the same will take place with the DA, but since it's a new map not seeing why that could not be the case as well.

Came across a live stream last night and one of the guys said he was surprised about how easy it was, the DA, but then said it's probably because they had six players. I'm not trash at this game but I'm not a super pro either. 

Oh well and I guess besides, after you get all the schematics out of the DA there may be zero point in returning to it. Game was fun whike it lasted woe is me"
Difficult_Map_9762_189tfws,"It's something that always bothered me when looking into the possible existence of biblical God, this God whom no question is tough enough for him to answer, the problem that God will not give everyone the same answer to actual important matters. 

Maybe an example would be something in the petty and of zero importance category - should I wear the red shirt or green shirt today? Then people will say that God answered them. But then if someone asks God for an answer about something which plagues Christianity, I guess what seems to be an everlasting and a super prevalent topic today ""is homosexuality a sin?"", he gives out contradictory answers. One person (or potentially millions) will say that God answered them and said no it is not. But then someone or multiple someone's will state that God answered them and told them that homosexuality is a sin. 

An interesting collaboration within Christianity - get millions of Christians together and have everyone ask God for an answer to an important topic. See what comes back. I'll just go out on a limb and suggest that he wouldn't answer everyone the same. Which puts God into the category of not actually a prayer answering God. Maybe even to the extreme that God does not exist. The Biblical one at least.

So I guess as the title states - God does not care to answer questions of actual importance"
Difficult_Map_9762_188r5n9,"This game has hit the point for me where I just go to the middle and farm bounties, do a couple supply runs here and there. It's usually a lonely time, many a games spent running for my life alone. Hopefully the new update is fun and good for solo players, unsure. 

But it is fun to try for the schematics, ray gun and level two pack a punch and epic tool plan. And my best pull came this evening, both the epic tool plan and a ray gun plan showed up in my contract rewards. Was able to find a player who had neither, nice to hook people up gives me something to do. 

That's about it  just wanted to share that"
Difficult_Map_9762_17xfcf4,"So I understand that our version (humans) of love is supposedly different from that of God. People say he'll put you through trials but it's for your best, it's tough love or something along those lines. But if God is love, and this is coming from a place of experience, then he wouldn't let someone develop stress and other forms of mental issues from seeking out if he actually exists. 

Perhaps somewhat unrelated but at the same time not, Catholic guilt. To deny that there are Catholics who develop mental issues from the guilt which goes along with that belief system would be turning ones head the other direction, denial in a way, or perhaps it would be suggested that the person is just mentally ill to begin with. So that's an odd one, that God actually wants you to stress over guilt. My situation which I've recently escaped from is similar, but mine had to do with seeking out if God even exists in the first place.

For the amount of attention God wants you to give him, pretty sure the Bible can be referenced for that, well the least the guy could do would be to step in and take the pain and mental anguish away when trying to seek the truth in his existence. Personally, I set God's existence down and have since moved on from truly seeking, which has resulted in better sleep and no hyperfocusing. Back to reality, I guess you could say. 

So yea, IMO and from personal experience, if God is love (whatever that actually means) then he wouldn't let you go through mental struggles when seeking his existence. It can affect the way your body functions and stress can lead to high blood pressure and even heart attacks, just to name a few. 

The idea that I've rejected God or the enemy has won is just a go-to mantra of sorts. And if life is better and my mind is healthy from moving on from Biblical God then I'll certainly stay away from Christianity, or any other religion which proposes one divine creator. 

Hopefully that all kinda makes sense, what I'm proposing, strange version of love if God allows you to develop stress and mental issues from merely seeking his existence."
Difficult_Map_9762_17uaghs,"The Bible does not do itself any favors either, it's pretty simple in the explanation of creation, a few God created all of the animals and plants verses then on to more important matters. Like (generic and redundant inbound) not eating pork and love God more than anything.

The argument of complexity seems to actually fall apart when thinking about how complex everything is. On my end at least. Even just a blade of grass or a grain of sand. The Bible lacks content about the natural world why is there not more for those who connect with nature? Besides the worship the creator and not the creation verse. 

You have God wiping out all the animals in the flood then new animals come along and he wants a bunch of them sacrificed, some guy hitting a donkey then the donkey asks why, followed by God making a whale swallow Jonah. But no real meat, nothing engaging for the naturalist of sorts.

Sort of hard to put into words but when I sit and think about everything in the world, and how basic and lacking the Bible is, well yes God did not do a very good job of engaging with people who love nature. Same could perhaps be said for those who love astronomy it's pretty basic info in the Bible. Perhaps a mention of worlds upon worlds in the universe instead of just mentioning the stars. 

So I guess the Bible and God fall apart, depending upon the individual, when complexity is called into the picture. Not sure if everything written in this post paved the way for any kind of a debate, was not trying to tell a story or offer up some giant musing, but there's something not right going on in the Bible and it's the lack of detail. Memorable detail.

So yes, the word God and what follows in the Bible is too simple. Even if you just pick up a blade of grass and look at it. But that's just me, just the way trying to believe in God worked out. 

Horrible post? Probably lol just wanted to offer something up."
Difficult_Map_9762_17rbrnh,"Ever feel like you're walking down the potato chip aisle except that nothing looks good? When it comes down to something to believe in, be a part of, look into to see if it's yummy for your brain. 

Personally, and not that it matters just thinking out loud mostly, but personally none of this has an ultimate purpose, life. That unshakeable core belief doesn't exactly feel good, does not get my hands thrown into the air in praise of the inbound return to not existing, it's merely a fit. Kinda sucks to believe this but what other proof is there that something is after this life? Some supposed god-given dream? An NDE? Those things prove nothing, IMO at least. 

So it's nihilism, without ever knowing that nihilism was a thing up until not all that long ago. Why is it that from a fairly young age I did not see anything after this life? Jesus and God were all around me, church's and peoples cross necklaces, TV shows and Bibles, why did that not become truth? Where was God to draw me to the truth?

Like actually draw me, and not from God ""working through someone.""

It's pretty dumb to think about all of this. God. I guess keep the beliefs if it makes someone feel better I'm still searching but kinda feel like I've already exited the potato chip aisle. To each thier own."
Difficult_Map_9762_17qlw3b,"Might sound a little satirical, but yea God does not have access to the internet. He has to rely upon man to get online.

So he can't browse the internet either, because he's spirit and does not own a computer. If he wants to look something up he cannot, he's at the mercy of what people are doing. So he's kinda stuck watching reruns of the Brady Bunch (or anything else) against his will."
Difficult_Map_9762_17id8g4,"Hi, new person here and just looking for a place to drop off my thoughts and maybe get some feedback. Maybe I'm just lonely and looking for attention as well. 

I kinda live in this invisible state of mind, on the outside I come across as happy and positive but more often than not as I open my eyes to start the day it's there waiting for me - no real purpose for me being here. But I do not want others to exist where I do, I actually like the idea that people find meaning and feel a connection to existing. And my head space, where I end up and quite often, the waking moments of a dark room, well it's not fun.

Full moon this morning. Was unaware until I sat down in my car to head to work. As I sit here in the work parking lot and rambling on the moon has since disappeared behind whatever those people do in that building, thier job. It's a gray building with a few docks, that green light is still flashing and perhaps will be doing so after I'm gone from this planet, which could happen at any moment, my not being here, and it's strangley comforting to know that I will not be here someday. That my mind will shut off and for good. That I'll no longer have to wake up alone in a dark room with my weird brain. 

Thirty minutes. Thirty more to complete this wall of text that no one gives a shit about, because in 30 they need me to clock in. So what else....oh, the moon. It brought to mind what comes to mind here and there, the billions of years that it took for me to be sitting here doing this. It's funny to think about, life did all this struggling and work for me to be here just for me to give life the finger (sometimes) and call it pointless. It is funny, no?

My manager just pulled up past me. She's a Christian with a husband and kids. Believes in Jesus and that horse shit perfect afterlife thing. But I like her, and I help her laugh. And by making others laugh it makes me smile. So in those moments life is not so bad, for laughter is a vacation, a temporary escape from....well yea there's no point to any of this. 

The internet told me that nihilism is the belief that there's no meaning to life. Apparently it goes deeper than that, further elaborated upon, but if I got into looking further in...well I'd probably end up where I did with Christianity. Which was....I dunno. Doesn't seem to need elaborated upon. It's meaningless. 

One or my coworkers just pulled up past me and parked. The sun hasn't even risen yet and he's blasting that music (if you want to call it that) where it's a guy rawr-rawr-rawring into the mic. Hard-core rock where the guitar line and drums basically all sounds the same. But he's a nice guy and it seems as if he does not have the same outlook on life as I do. Guess that I could ask him, but what's the point in that? 

I just enjoy doing this. If nothing else. Wake up and jot something down. And I could basically go on all day about weird stuff but I'm guessing everyone here has heard all of this before, and from some random person who wandered through and dropped off a wall of WGAS. But happy Saturday, life is not always....well even though I see no meaning and purpose it still has it moments. And it's funny that billions of years went by in order for me to exist just for me to say up yours, life."
Difficult_Map_9762_179wt3n,"Obviously my opinion and not a direct jab at Christians and those who suggest they've met God, so apologies if it seems as if I'm attacking.

Everyone has had odd things happen. Like the time I said something to my coworker about the Bermuda triangle and playing through one of thier earbuds was something about the Bermuda triangle She was a bit startled by that and let me know what was playing in her ears at that very moment. My comment to them was that the universe works in mysterious ways (due to what happened) and they agreed, no reply from her that it was an act of God, our interaction.

Plus, people have sought God for years and never heard back. Not through an ear bud interaction persay, but just in any noticeable way. And who knows it could just be the universe, should they hear back. 

I'm not sure if this is a debate worthy post nor am I one to debate all that much, this sub is obviously heady I'm merely someone who's listened to hours of both sides of the equation and having God reveal himself to a person is just pattern seeking and/or coincidence. Just my opinion."

Difficult_Map_9762_16btta8,"So I have some questions, but they might be a little annoying. Perhaps not fun to answer, controversial in a sense, theologically speaking. 

Have come across this a lot and it's that someone who left faith/belief was never a true Christian. Plenty of stories and deconversion accounts out there, exchristian testimonials of sorts. But they did truly believe. But the individuals are sometimes told that Jesus and God never knew them in the first place, calvinism or something. 

Personally, I tried. With the internet you obviously have instant access to all things belief and non-belief, not something which was available and not all that long ago, but part of what made faith impossible for me was all the divisions within Christianity. The fun one of calvnisim as well.

Forgot to ask a question but I'd guess it would be this one - how can someone be deemed to have never believed, when they spent years serving the lord, evangelizing and such. And how can God blame an individual for taking a close look at himself, and not finding him. 

I wanted this to work out, but it did not. So wherever I'm headed after this life is out of my control. Faking till I make it, not an option on my end."

But these past couple years I’ve only been picking out $50-$100 worth of stuff. I just hate the way everything looks on my body. I’m so insecure about the way I look.

Lately she’s been stuck in my mind, she’s been popping up in my dreams and even when I’m trying to meditate. Everything I do leads me back to her. Images of her kept popping up everywhere I went, which is weird because she’s a more obscure character. I felt so detached from her a few months ago so what happened, why is she weaseling herself back into my life and heart. And why am I so afraid of her? Why am I trying to run away? Sorry there’s a lot on my mind. "

But I still love her and am struggling to let go of the past. I miss her but I know things wouldn’t work out, I’ve tried multiple times.

Last night I had a dream where we got back together, it felt so surreal. It’s made me wake up confused and conflicted. I love Chongyun, I really do. I am happy with him but I feel as if my prior relationship is haunting me. "

After some consideration, I have decided to start a new relationship. I’m anxious about it but I Think it’ll be ok. I’m not sure what else to say, I’m nervous to say who it is. 

So, without further ado, I introduce, Chongyun from Genshin Impact. I have been playing Genshin more to help get my mind off the break up, and I found a lot of comfort in Chongyun. He was always my favorite character, and the first character that I ever pulled. He holds a special place in my heart. Therefore I have decided to pursue a relationship with him.

I loved her more than words can describe and I threw it away over my own fears. I need to do better for her.

Typical_District_987_18za1jb,"Hello. You may know me as the Claire Rouge waifuist. Unfortunately Claire and I broke up. I am still getting over things, but it was for the best. I was being someone I wasn’t to make her happy. She was happy, but I wasn’t. And I was lying to myself when I told myself I was. I had mentioned before that I am normally attracted to men, which is true, so I came to the realization that I don’t like girls as much as I thought. It caused for so many problems in our relationship. I have also decided to detransition. I came to another realization that I only identified as trans masc so that Claire would love me. 

Thoughts of my ex flooded my mind for months. And no matter how far back I tried to push them, they always came back. I did my hardest to be happy and make my relationship with Claire work. But it was useless, we were bound to fail. I made the hard decision to let her go. She still means so much to me, so we have agreed to stay friends.

Now to be myself. I have decided to switch, to Leviathan from Obey me! He was always a comfort character for me and was always on my mind. He made me smile when I felt I couldn’t. I feel secure with him, which is something Claire never provided for me. This probably isn’t the update many wanted, but I have been thinking about this for months.

Typical_District_987_18hex0u,"Oh my dearest Claire,
Can you believe it’s been 6 months already? It feels just like yesterday I was falling for you, as you gracefully fought on my screen. Your firey nature and passion entranced me. I have adores our time together, though short I know you’re the woman for me. The girl of my dreams. My soulmate. It’s childish of me to say such things, but as a hopeless romantic I can’t help it. I wanted nothing more than to make you comfortable and happy. I love seeing the light on your face when you give you a new gift or take you out to dinner. I could stare at your beautiful smile all day long. I know we’ve had our ups and downs though our relationship. But u just want you to know that this is a huge milestone for us. And we shall celebrate many more years together. Through thick and thin I shall stay by your side. You’ve given me true love and I cannot thank you enough. You’ve truely made me one of the happiest men of all time. You motivate me to get through these rough days, those long hours at work, and the low points of my life. You make things bearable, and you make me stronger. I love you. I can for once in my life confidently say that. I thought I knew love before I met you, but I was so very wrong. You’ve taught me so much. So much to do with relationships, emotions, and even about myself. You bring out the best in me. As I hope I bring out the best in you. The girls in your school may be mean, however I am always going to be your #1 supporter. I want to be with you through your low points, as you’ve done for me. I want to be your shoulder to cry on, so please don’t hesitate to come to me. You’re such a wonderful person. You’re overlooked by the “fandom” as some basic Tsundere. Yet you’re so much more than that. You’re complex, and I wish more people could see that. I hope one day I can marry you, make you truly mine. I can just imagine how beautiful you’d look dressed in white, holding flowers, and with a shiny tiara upon your head. You’d look absolutely stunning. I’m just rambling now, but I love you so deeply Claire. More than anything. 

Happy 6 month anniversary, my beloved Shrine Princess ❤️‍🔥"

I thank you Claire, for being a wonderful partner and person. You’re so supportive of me. With my transition, hobbies, and my mental health. You’ve stuck with me through it all. And I can thank you enough. 

I thank you for putting me in line when I need a little push. Like forcing me to get out of bed in the morning for work, to make breakfast and other meals when I don’t feel like eating. You make me take care of myself. I don’t Think I’d be as stable as I am without you in my life. 

I thank you for all the love you give me. 
Whether it’s giving me quick kisses when im leaving for work, or snuggling when we play games/watch movies. I cherish all our moments together. You brighten my life, and make me feel like I can actually be loved.

It’s something I’ve struggled with. Feeling like im not enough. And sometimes I feel im not enough for you. That I need to be and do better. Everything is for you. I wouldn’t have it any other way…

Typical_District_987_17v90eg,"I (20F) am the oldest of 5 kids. I currently live with my Dad, and my sisters visit us every weekend. I should state that I normally do not like kids, and don’t really want any of my own. The only exceptions are family which I love unconditionally. 

My little sister (8F) who I will call S, has a friend (8M) who we will call M. I don’t like M, but I’m not going to tell my sister who she can and can’t be friends with. M is pretty entitled. He will steal S’s snacks and pop, hog/steal her tablet and remote when they’re playing minecraft (we have more than one remote too so it never made sense). He calls her stupid and tells her to shut up. Needless to say, he’s a little bully. I’ve told M on multiple occasions he needs to be nicer to S. Each time seems to go in one ear and out the other. 

This particular day, M was pulling all his usual antics. However, he decided to pull a prank on S. He shut all the blinds in her room, turned off the light, and locked her in the room, saying that Slenderman was after her. He said that Slenderman was going to kill her. S, being the sensitive 8 year old she is, started to freak out and cry. Our other sister (11F) ran to me to let me know what was going on. My blood was boiling. I kicked the door open, grabbed my sister and yelled at M to get out of the house. I also said that he was not coming back until he started treating S better. He started to cry too and ran home. I spent the next few minutes calming S down and holding her. 

M lives right across the street. I noticed that whenever I go to take the trash out, or the dog out, or even if I’m just leaving the house. If his parents are outside, they Glare at me. I at first shrugged it off. But today M came to the house to tell me that his parents want me to apologize for yelling at him. I refused. They’ve started to text my ex step-mom about the situation and my family is wanting me to just give in and apologize. I understand. M is not my child or sibling and I probably had no right to raise my voice at him. So AITA?"

I worry Blade and Claire won’t care for them. Or Think that I’m adding someone to the relationship because I need more from them. They’re already perfect and I’d be perfectly content with just those two. I love them more than anything."

I hav a friend who’s wanting to start HSR. Which is great! I would love to have more people to talk to about it. But I worry they’ll gain an interest in Blade. They’d done things similar in the past. Playing games or watching animes and then catching feelings for characters I have feelings for. It sends me into a spiral. I don’t Think I could handle it with Blade. It was manageable in the past but I live Blade too much to see that happen. I’m a nervous anxious wreck thinking about them getting with Blade. 

When I see a Dupe I get all crazy. I try to be the “better” partner. I push myself to be perfect and often neglect other things in my life to be “better”. I know he isn’t mine, I know I don’t have a right to control someone else’s relationship or crushes because of my own selfish feelings."

I’ve expressed before that I don’t have attraction to real people (Atleast to my knowledge). There’s been a few isolated cases where I’ve read my emotions wrong or have been manipulated into feeling the same way as someone. But by myself I don’t believe I am capable of it. 

Many people say that I am not ficto because of a 2 year long abusive relationship with my ex boyfriend. Who is in fact a real person. I’m not really open about my past with this. But it is possible I’m ficto because of trauma. Which does make me feel like I’m a fake and don’t belong in spaces like this

I’ve always loved fictional characters more than real people. When I was 8 I was deeply in love with Link from Legend of Zelda. And wasn’t interested in other kids in my class. Back then I was so young no one batted an eye to it. Over the years I tried to force myself into relationship settings, I wanted to be like everyone else and normal. Even if I didn’t feel anything. The only real person I’ve ever felt love for was my abusive ex. But I question if it was genuine feelings, or my mind being manipulated. He controlled everything about me. Who I say, what I wore, what I ate, etc. I Think he controlled how I felt for him too in some weird way. But other than him, I haven’t been attracted to anyone since."

He’s a pretty hated character but that honestly just makes me go into protect mode. Im not sure I can handle another person in the polycule but if this crush persists I don’t know what’ll happen…

I also will not say who his is, and if I do decide to have him included in the relationship I will leave this sub out of fear of being judged or called names."
Typical_District_987_16yvs9u,"Im over thinking. 
Am I being selfish? We know that Blade is in constant pain, his body is always ripping apart and healing itself with no break. His memories and own mind is messed up because of Mara sickness. He’s being controlled and brainwashed by the stelleron hunters, but is that because he wants to be? I also know his one wish is to die. It’s even said in his own voice lines. “Why am I here? Just to suffer?”

He’s in so much pain mentally, emotionally, and physically I feel awful. I want to be the light in his life, I want to make his pain go away. But am I capable of that? 

I Think that’s what puts me apart from most Blade “fans”. He’s more than attractive edgelord. Im not “I can fix him”. I want to ease his pain, even if it’s just a little bit. But does he want that help? Will I even be enough for him."

I left because I was insecure. I couldn’t handle Kamito (her love interest), or the fact the fandom treats her like an object.

She loves both, but I wasn’t sure which would be a better beginner spider but I’m gonna assume the jumping spider. Or if we should just stick to the almighty goldfish for now lol. 

Any thoughts??"

Hi!! I’m Jill. I’m 23. I’m super new here and grew up in a very conservative family and town, and so I need help figuring out what my deal is! lol.

I feel like this is probably dumb, but I’ve been struggling lately. I’ve always said I’m bisexual. I’ve had experiences with both men and women, and I enjoyed both. I’ve only ever dated men though, as I live in a super conservative area (southeast Texas) and I’m fairly certain that would go badly for me lol. But I have always felt attraction towards men and women, my first kiss was with a girl, my second and third kiss were with girls, I did attempt to ask out my best friend who is a girl when I was a kid (she rejected me lol), and then I’ve dated guys and kissed guys and I have a kid with a guy and what not. 

So I’ve always just said I’m bisexual, but I feel like I can’t be comfortable saying that. Here’s why, and maybe I’m just over thinking.

I am very attracted to androgynous people. I’ve always found Frank N Furter to be WAY more attractive than say Ryan Gosling lol. A lot of the men I’ve dated have been super androgynous. And also, if I’m watching a movie or so, I focus on the female. I find it very difficult to not focus on the female. But I also focus on the man. But I am very attracted to androgynous people. 

I don’t actually care about their gender or sexuality or anything, it’s really more about how we vibe for me. But I love me a man that looks like a woman lol. And just women. And just men. And just anyone, idk.

I feel like I’m comfortable presenting as a female (my biological sex) but somedays I kind of want to come off masculine? Like I want to be called she/her even though I feel like a he/him somedays. 

All this is to say, I don’t know what’s going on and I have no one to talk to about this lol. My sexual orientation, and my gender I guess. I want to be called a female. But I want to look masculine sometimes, and I wanna look feminine sometimes. I don’t know, maybe I’m just being stupid. Anyone else like me in here?"

ChallengeOk2114_1b7ktl8,"The guy who helped me realize it wasn’t my fault, and that I was being heavily manipulated/abused, has now decided that’s not the case, I guess. I don’t even have the energy to talk about it all. And I’m so exhausted. 

My ex was very abusive. A grade A narcissist, mirroring the exact definition. I don’t even wanna type out what he’d do to me, but it was traumatic. Some things have never surfaced from me, and I can’t even say what he did to anyone, not even those who think they know everything. We did end up breaking up, and I got with a new man who treated me great.

During my new man and I’s relationship, My ex would threaten me with harming himself or disappearing if I didn’t talk to him ((while my bf and I were together)), and one time I had a concussion from a car crash and he manipulated me into sex ((I was single for this)) and my man had helped me realize that he was a bad person doing bad things to me. Because I blamed myself for everything bad he did to me. My ex helped me on multiple occasions to realize that he was using,abusing, and manipulating me.

Now my man has found a new partner and he completely switched up on me. I am now disrespectful towards him because of everything my ex did. I don’t blame my man for being upset that I continued contact, or that I hung out with him once. I am just sad because I thought he understood me, and why I was even talking to him. I felt like I had a human life in my hands because of how manipulative he was. I also think that he believes I cheated on him with my ex. I could never cheat, I never have and never will. I don’t know where this switch up came from. But I feel more alone than ever. I don’t know. I’m not mad at him for being upset. I’m just mad that I’m back to blaming myself."

ChallengeOk2114_15574lu,"I feel so bad about it, but it's true. In a world where women and their mothers have okay relationships, I feel as if I am the outlier. I would have grown up in a normal home if it weren't for her. My parents have been married since I was 3, and I have an older sister and a younger brother. Growing up, my sister was our mom. She started mothering us when she was about 9, while my parents worked or went out by themselves. This already damaged her relationship with my sister. She and my mother going forward were always having screaming matches. Throwing stuff at each other, screaming, physically fighting, slamming doors, etc. My dad never stepped in because he can't stand up to her (my mother.) She is unrelentless. She won't stop once she gets going. I remember growing up and hearing my mother tell my little brother how she didn't ask to be his mother. Her throwing coffee cups at my sister and calling her a b\*ch and a w\*\*re. Her telling me she wanted to abort me but didn't because she didn't want to harm her reputation. 

These are all scattered moments and she wasn't like this all the time, but they still happened. And she was volatile like this enough for it to permanently effect all of us.  


 Our whole lives, we have been walking on eggshells around her but we're just now getting old enough to see what a problem it is/was.   
She's not always terrible. She's usually sitting on the couch watching TV with her headphones in, not saying anything or listening to anyone. And if you get her attention, she gets annoyed. So we just leave her alone.   


We live in a pretty unaffordable time, so my 5 year old daughter and I still live with her and my father. It is hell. If I could afford to go any place else, I would. Don't get me wrong, I am grateful and aware that there are people less fortunate than I. But I don't want to spend my life being told what I can and can't do with my kid. Why does my mother feel like she needs to tell me when to bathe, feed, and put my kid to bed? I have never not been able to do this on my own. I don't know why she does this, but it feels as if my mother does not see me as a grown person. She downplays my mental health, she makes fun of me, she uses my past self-destruction attempt against me as a manipulation tactic, and I swear she just can't stand to be around me sometimes.  


I actually tried moving out recently into government housing but she screamed and cried at me when she found out because when she lived in government housing 20 years ago, it wasn't good for her. She manipulated me into staying and I feel awful about it.  


She lets her dogs piss and shit in the house. It is absolutely fucking disgusting. I always clean it when I see it because I don't want my kid living in filth. If it weren't for me and my dad, this house would be a wreck but we put in just enough effort for it to look presentable for guests. It is so embarrassing to have people come over and they discover dog shit, or piss on the floor. Oh, and it's our faults. Because why would it be hers?  


My father had Vertigo and Bell's Palsy recently and she accused him of faking it so he wouldn't have to do anything and get special treatment. Y'all, he was throwing up and couldn't stand with a walker. He's better now, but I'll never forget that.  


Last year I think, she started therapy. It has helped, I will say. Because now she sits quietly and doesn't say much at all. Not that she doesn't lash out and get stupid sometimes, but you know. Either way, whether she goes to therapy or not, the damage is done. My brother (19) and I, still listen to how she walks/closes doors to get her mood before we talk to her. He and I still look at each other and sigh and go to our rooms when we hear her get home. I'm doing everything I can to  get out of this house. I'm in college that I'm paying for COMPLETELY on my own. I'm about to get a job as a CMA so maybe that'll help. I don't know. Has anyone else ever had a relationship like this before with their mother? Did anything help?

Maybe this is just me being sensitive or whatever, but it hurts my feelings. Shouldn’t he be concerned that I won’t like them and not the other way around? Shouldn’t he be excited to introduce me to his friends? Does he tell them about our arguments/disagreements and now they don’t like me?

I haven’t felt like myself in years, until last year when I started dating my boyfriend. He (22M) has healed me in ways I didn’t know I needed healing. I’m not done yet, but god he’s making me feel like a real person who deserves love and compassion again.

All I can think about is having a baby with him and having a happy pregnancy this time. I want to see him excited, I want to feel him touching and kissing my belly, I want him to be happy with me. I want my little girl to be a big sister like she’s been talking about forever now. I want her to be happy.

It does not help at all. My fear of death effects my everyday life. I always take the long way to work and end up late because I’m afraid I’ll die on the highway.

When I first started really failing, nobody cared much. Eventually, it became every assignment had an F on it. One of my biggest memories is my mom telling me that it was embarrassing. I think we knew there was a problem around 8th grade? Maybe freshman year of highschool. I cannot do anything with math. Adding, subtracting, multiplication, division, it’s all useless. Grouping numbers, geometry, reading old speedometers, reading clocks, mental math, it’s all impossible. I passed everything with flying colors, I’m talking straight A’s. But math always had a bit fat F or a 0. And I did every assignment. I showed work. I got tutoring. All to no avail. I even dropped out of college and math was a huge factor in that.

ChallengeOk2114_zs40bj,"This is a long one

TL;DR: trauma bond almost destroyed my relationship 

I (F22) just broke out of a trauma bond with my ex (21M, we’ll call him John) that had lasted for 10 years. He and I started dating officially in August 2020, and broke up in December 2021. But for about 8-9 years before that, it was me wanting to be with him and him stringing me along. He used me for sex so bad. He made sure he was my only source of friendship and trust. If I had a friend that I talked about, he’d guilt trip me for having a “new best friend.” He used my BPD against me, he used my abandonment issues against me, and he used my feelings against me. The year that he and I were together was the most exhausting and painful year of my life. It was a year that I spent questioning if this was as good as it gets. If I deserved the emotional abuse and manipulation I was receiving from him. The unfaithfulness, he called me unattractive, it was my fault he resorted to porn, he had videos and pictures of he and his ex having sex. I was suicidal, I wanted to die. I broke up with him in my head like 3 months before I actually worked up the courage to do it.

But I couldn’t get away from him. Even after I did break up with him, I couldn’t get away. He acted so painfully pitiful. And he so perfectly manipulated me into thinking that everything was my fault. I should’ve lost the weight. I should’ve put out more. I should’ve let him talk to his exes and I should’ve shaped myself around him. Me breaking up with him was selfish of me and I hurt him more than he ever hurt me.

The part that it really gets shaky is that eventually after he and I broke up, I got with our friend. We’ll call him Bob. Bob (22M) was a friend of both of ours. I broke one day and I told Bob everything that John had did to me. He decided that he didn’t want to be associated with John anymore if John was abusive to me. A couple weeks after I told Bob, there was definitely some feelings. And it wasn’t a quick or easy decision, it was very meticulously thought out and took a lot of discussing and thinking. But we ended up together. And I have never EVER had a better partner in my life. I am so happy with this man, I can hardly contain it.

John found out that I was dating Bob. And John lost his shit. He started sitting outside of my house and watching. He stalked me. He threatened Bob and he kind of threatened me with the old “why should anyone have you if I can’t?” 

This put a lot of strain on Bob and I’s relationship and he broke up with me twice throughout the year we’d been together. 

After the first time,The same day Bob and I broke up, I got in a major car accident with John and got a concussion and some spinal damage. That same night, John had sex with me. I feel like I wasn’t thinking clearly and I feel like I didn’t really want to the entire time. But I didn’t say no.

One of those times ended up with me having sex with John as a rebound. It wasn’t long after that I decided that I wanted to permanently remove John from my life, as he got what he wanted and he did it so well. He perfectly manipulated me the whole entire time. He threatened to kill himself, he threatened to leave and forget about me, he did it all and when Bob broke and left, he slithered in and did what he does.

I know nobody can make decisions for me. And I know I decided and made the adult decision to hook up with John. But I wish I could explain the chokehold this motherfucker had on me. I felt like I couldn’t live without him. I felt like if I lost contact with him, I would go insane. He had me like this for 10 years because he made me believe that without him, I had nothing.

I am now about a month and a half John free. Bob and I are together and are putting the past behind us and moving on stronger. But the guilt and the anger eats me alive every day. I want those 10 years back. I wish I never met John. And I’m very upset with myself and I’m regretful of how I could’ve hurt Bob in this process. I hate myself for it. I’m so thankful and so glad he decided to see this through with me. He understands that it was a trauma bond. And he has heard me out 100%. But God, I hate myself for it.

I really want my life with Bob to continue. And I want him to know how precious and how treasured he is. I can’t see myself with anyone else. I just wish I could’ve taken out the trash a lot sooner."
ChallengeOk2114_zlbejr,"My daughter (5) and I (22F) live with my parents. I had my own place, but had to move back home after my ex boyfriend and I broke up. I couldn’t stay in the house with him, as he was very emotionally abusive and every single day was a fight.

My parents welcomed me back home and I was and still am extremely grateful for that. If my mom told me to lick the toilet clean, I’d do it. I pay for everything except utilities and rent. I’m pretty much living there for free besides helping out with groceries and other little things like that. 

Everything would be fine if it weren’t for her dogs. I never really say anything because she and my dad somehow don’t have a problem with it, but her little dogs (chihuahuas) pee and poop in the house. Every. Single. Day. Every day I walk out of my room, I step in a pee puddle. Or I have to pick up poop. They get let out every hour or two for about 30 to an hour. And they go outside, I watch them!! But she claims we don’t let them outside enough. 

What really bothers me is the room that my daughter and I share. The floors are so stained with piss. It’s so noticeable. There isn’t an odor, thank god, but it’s awful. I leave my doors closed but while I’m at work, my mom uses my TV in the room with my daughter and takes her dogs in there with her and they pee all over my floor. I let her know it bothers me and she says “They’re marking their territory.” And I’m like maybe it’s because you don’t let them out enough.

ChallengeOk2114_y4pq8h,"I (22F) met my aunt when I was about 5, when she married my uncle. I always looked up to her. I always thought she was super cool until one day she went off on my aunt for seemingly no reason. I don’t remember what it was about, but I just remember my view on her completely shifting. After that, I always saw her fighting with my uncle over seemingly little things and it scared me. She regularly physically attacked my uncle and he had to defend himself. By this point I was uncomfortable around her mostly every time I saw her, and it wasn’t long after that I found out the rest of my family felt the same. She and my uncle moved to Illinois (We are from Texas) and I haven’t seen them in years and I would be 100% okay with never seeing them again. Earlier this year, she started a fight with me. She was cussing out my cousin on Facebook, so I stood up for her. She then proceeded to call me a narcissist, cuss me out too,Bash my Facebook account and call me a child (I am 22.) So I deleted her on Facebook and left her group chat she made for my cousins and I. Now today, she’s in our big family group chat calling me rude because I made a joke about how my cousin having a baby at 30 isn’t that bad, since I had mine at 16. She stresses me out so bad and I do not want to return her energy because I want to be the bigger person, but I swear I would just rather never see her again. She has added absolutely nothing to my life and she is toxic, and all she does is make everyone uncomfortable. 

Tl;Dr My aunt is mean and I don’t want to see her again"
ChallengeOk2114_xk0chm,"It happened. He left me for good. He is so unsure of his feelings towards me and he’s so worried that he doesn’t really love me, that he left me for good.

ChallengeOk2114_vnrrse,"Hi! So at the beginning of May, I had a hook up. This hook up had had a semi recent partner at the beginning of April that tested positive for chlamydia, and he didn’t use a condom with her. He went and got tested, which was negative, but they went ahead and made him finish a course of antibiotics anyway. We didn’t hook up until about 2 weeks after he finished his antibiotics AND we used a condom. After we hooked up, he went and got tested again and it was negative again. Once again, this happened at the beginning of May.

About a weeks had a UTI and was put on antibiotics. I started having symptoms of a yeast infection, so I started monistat for it. I’m having some pretty thick white/clear discharge but no odor. I’m itchy and there is some slight swelling. I didn’t think much of it but today I started spotting and my period isn’t due for over a week. 

Does this still sound like a yeast infection or could I have miraculously picked up Chlamydia through a condom, two negative tests, and a finished cautionary antibiotic course?"
ChallengeOk2114_v7ac0e,"I’m a 21 year old female. I’ve been through SA in my early teen years and some childhood. It wasn’t lasting or anything but I remember it clearly. I’m afraid that this experience is making me irrationally horrified for my daughter. She is 4 years old. She shows no signs really, except for everytime she comes home from her dads, her underwear are filthy with what looks like skid marks but my brain is horrified that it’s blood. But no real signs. She sleeps fine, she’s very playful, she doesn’t talk about anything sexual, she’s okay around men, she LOVES running around without pants, and she’s just a normal 4 year old. No bruises, no nothing. But I am so horrified that I’m missing something and I don’t know how to stop the thoughts. I’m so scared of missing signs and having her go through this. Has anyone else dealt with this?"

but now i’m feeling inklings of those delusions again. i’m getting scared again that i’m the only consciousness. i know it might not be real but i can’t shake it. it’s scaring me and causing me a lot of stress. we upped my medication after that episode and i don’t think we can even go any higher.
