According to the plan each user gets 30 GB of storage, but one of the users (employee) surpassed the 30 GB and got a notification regarding it, and all of a sudden the user wasn't able to use the Google services(emails, drive, etc). The user was redirected to a page asking to choose a storage plan to further use the account. The user bought a 100TB plan from there redeeming Google Play Code. But he didn't get any confirmation nor any update regarding the plan up-gradation. The employer's account started working but still shows the account has surpassed the storage limit. Soon we took up the issue with the reseller and we came to know according to the plan we bought, users cant upgrade their individual storage. I talked with the Google people too, but they said as it's been bought from a reseller, they can't help much. I am in a spot on how to get back the Google Play redeem code or equivalent amount back as there is no direct customer care of Google dealing with these issues in India. Can someone please suggest to me how to settle this issue, whom to contact, and what all procedures are to be done to get back the amount?\n\nTLDR: Bought more Google Workspace storage individually, but the organization's Workspace plan doesn't allow it. How to get back the spent amount?",
